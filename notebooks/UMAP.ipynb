      "fellow professionals, his habit of calling the trainer during matches (now largely extinct)\n",
      "and his voluble father. But no one has yet set it against the background of his country’s\n",
      "emergence from the horrors of the 1990s bloodshed. This book is an attempt to do that.\n",
      " \n",
      "It would be tempting – though not entirely true – to say the seed for this book was sown in\n",
      "September 2010.\n",
      "I was in Belgrade for the first time, covering the Davis Cup semi-final between Serbia\n",
      "and the Czech Republic. I arrived on the Wednesday evening, and when I hooked up with\n",
      "the people I was working with, found that they’d arranged to eat at Novak’s, one of the two\n",
      "restaurants in Belgrade owned by Novak Djokovic. How appropriate – my first ever meal in\n",
      "Belgrade at the restaurant of the man who was putting Serbia on the map! And just one\n",
      "block from the Beogradska Arena, the 17,000-seater indoor stadium that had become the\n",
      "spiritual home of Serbian tennis.\n",
      "The following morning I had to interview Djokovic for television, and while we were\n",
      "waiting for the cameraman to get set up, I told him that I’d eaten at his restaurant the night\n",
      "before. He asked me what I thought of it. I hesitated, trying to think of the politest way to say\n",
      "that the food was very good (it was) but it was rather a long time coming (I’ve since learned\n",
      "that you do wait a long time for your food in Serbian restaurants and Novak’s isn’t\n",

      "getting there but it’s slow and we’ve a long way to go.’\n",
      "What struck me about his response was that it encapsulated the \n",
      "dual role Djokovic\n",
      "plays. He’s totally comfortable outside Serbia, fully integrated into the western European\n",
      "and North American culture where smoking in public places is now unacceptable\n",
      "(normally banned), where all good restaurants offer healthy options and where patriotism is\n",
      "welcomed but nationalism is viewed with suspicion, especially when it gets vociferous. Yet\n",
      "he’s also totally comfortable in his own country, even though he acts with a slightly\n",
      "different register – he’s a bit more jingoistic, happy to join in with Serbian songs and\n",
      "cultural rituals, even a bit of blatant nationalism. That, at least, is my impression. He\n",
      "himself denies it, saying he always acts the same: ‘I always try to be respectful and kind to\n",
      "everyone no matter what country they come from, or where I am on the map. That applies\n",
      "to my compatriots, too.’ That may indeed be his intention, though I stand by my sense that\n",
      "there are subtle changes he makes when he’s in his homeland.\n",
      "That brief exchange wasn’t the genesis of this book but it played an important role when\n",
      "John Blake Publishing came to me in 2012 and asked if I would write a biography of\n",
      "Djokovic. My first step was to approach Djokovic’s agent and see if an authorised\n",
      "biography or ghosted autobiography might be on the cards. I was told that neither was an\n",
      "option, as Djokovic wants to write his own book when his playing career ends. That left me\n",
      "with the option of an independent biography of Djokovic, or nothing. As I had written Roger\n",
      "Federer’s biography on that basis and updated it several times, I had no particular desire to\n",
      "write another straight tennis biography, so I told Blake I wasn’t up for the Djokovic book.\n",
      "Blake’s staff came back saying they were particularly keen to have a book about\n",

      "about how Djokovic spans these two cultures: the Serbian and the international. I’ve also\n",

      "of Djokovic’s own story and Serbia’s\n",

      "embellished. But Djokovic himself has corroborated a lot of it in interviews, and others who\n",
      "were around at the time say it all stacks up.\n",
      "A central feature of Gencic is that she was interested only in tennis and personal\n",
      "development. She was not into money – she received countless offers to run private tennis\n",
      "camps but always turned them down. She was a woman of left-of-centre political views\n",
      "and was clearly at home in a state-controlled economy where, if a service was offered, it\n",
      "was offered to everyone regardless of income or other means. She said, ‘I was a tennis\n",
      "player, so I didn’t want to receive anything, I wanted only to help.’ She also had a\n",

      "and help the children get better. The best is the child who is No. 1.’ In the course of her\n",
      "interviews for this book, she was given plenty of opportunities to claim clairvoyant skills for\n",
      "other aspects of Djokovic’s progression but declined, often with a firm ‘no’. So even if the\n",
      "story has improved with the telling, it is likely to be a true story at heart.\n",
      "However true it is, the sequence of events was weird and rushed enough for Dijana and\n",
      "Srdjan Djokovic to have been forgiven for being a tad mistrustful when this fifty-something\n",
      "coach walked into their restaurant with their first-born and said he could be a world-beater\n",
      "by 17. Gencic had clearly got the bit between her teeth and was purring enthusiastically\n",
      "about little Novak. She even claimed to have said to them, ‘This boy is mine, I must make\n",
      "him the best in the world,’ which sounds almost dangerous. Shortly afterwards, she said,\n",
      "she came to the conclusion that she needed to give up everything except her TV job –\n",
      "which she needed to earn her living – to make sure Djokovic had the start he needed.\n",
      "At first the Djokovics didn’t say a word. Then they went away and tried to find out who\n",
      "this strange woman was and whether she \n",
      "was as crazy as she seemed. Everyone who\n",
      "knew her told them she had discovered and worked with Monica Seles, which at the time\n",
      "was about the best reference she could have had. So they let Gencic work with their boy.\n",
      "She did, however, bring them somewhat down to earth the following day. She told them,\n",
      "‘If you want me to work with Novak, I have only one condition – I will do my best for his\n",
      "tennis but don’t ask me about money – that’s your problem not mine.’ Gencic knew that\n",
      "within a couple of years they would need much more money for equipment, tournaments,\n",
      "travel, etc. Initially, it all came free – Gencic didn’t charge anything; she used her position\n",
      "as president of Partizan Belgrade, one of only two state-funded tennis clubs in the country,\n",
      "to get him rackets, balls and everything else he needed. But to make it in the fiercely\n",
      "competitive world of professional tennis, he would need to find some money before long.\n",
      "Gencic and Djokovic started to work on day two of the summer camp. Gencic worked out\n",
      "a programme for him – one that lasted for five years. It needed to take account of the fact\n",
      "that he went to school in Belgrade but spent the summer months and part of the winter in\n",

      "money shielded the young boy from the family’s and country’s growing financial\n",
      "challenges, which were becoming more acute anyway – the Serbo-Croat war was raging\n",
      "and an embryonic capitalist system was replacing the collectivist economy that had been\n",
      "Yugoslavia’s reality since 1945. The programme she prepared for him was not just a\n",

      "likely to cost year by year and thus how much money the family \n",
      "had to be prepared to find.\n",
      "‘This is the terrible part of the Djokovic family’s life,’ she said. ‘I knew they didn’t have\n",
      "anything but neither did I. So I said they had to go to find some sponsors. They did find the\n",
      "money but with some terrible conditions. Srjdan has said publicly that he got loans with\n",
      "high interest rates, and when the day came to pay the money back and he hadn’t got any,\n",
      "he sometimes found a knife at his throat. The only way out was to take out a second loan to\n",
      "pay off the first loan, normally at very high rates.’\n",
      "These days, while Djokovic enjoys a very high standing among his compatriots, the\n",
      "same cannot be said for the rest of his family. His father and uncle have made enemies,\n",
      "both in broad society and specifically in tennis. In early 2011 a coup led by the Djokovic\n",
      "family resulted in the president of the Serbian Tennis Federation, Slobodan Zivojinovic,\n",
      "being ousted shortly after Serbia had won the 2010 Davis Cup and replaced by Vuk\n",
      "Jeremic, the president of the United Nations General Assembly and an ally of Srdjan\n",
      "Djokovic. But Gencic said the wider context has to be understood:\n",
      "People who criticise his parents don’t know or don’t want to know the full story of the\n",
      "Djokovic family from the beginning. They see only money now; they think he [Srdjan]\n",
      "is arrogant. The family were very friendly until they needed money for Novak. That\n",
      "was terrible. They knew that Novak would be the best, but how do you find money?\n",
      "They went out every day looking for money. Srdjan did get very angry but then he\n",
      "knocked on every door, including the government’s, asking for help – he constantly\n",
      "came up against ‘Who is this boy?’, ‘We don’t have money for this little boy.’ Now they\n",
      "like to say, ‘We made him.’ I’m very happy for Srdjan to claim the credit for it because\n",
      "what he did allowed Novak to go to tournaments. The Djokovic family has had a\n",
      "terrible life until now. These days they have the money but I’m not interested how\n",
      "they’re living. I’m only interested in how Novak and [his younger brothers] Marko and\n",
      "Djordje are doing.\n",
      "The work developing Novak Djokovic into a world-class tennis player progressed slowly\n",
      "but surely. He learned quickly but was a small boy, so Gencic sometimes had to wait for\n",
      "his body to catch up before she could move forward.\n",
      "Having grown up in the pre-Connors and pre-Evert era, Gencic’s natural inclination was\n",
      "to teach the one-handed backhand. So for the first year or so of his tennis career, Djokovic\n",
      "hit his backhand one-handed. Then one day, when he was about six and a half, he walked\n",
      "up to Gencic and asked very politely, ‘Please, Jeca, can I try to play the backhand with two\n",
      "hands?’ Gencic replied, ‘Of course, why not, but first of all I must explain to you how you\n",
      "must hold the racket for a two-handed backhand because you have three options: a left-\n",
      "handed forehand, a one-handed backhand with the second hand, or a genuinely two-\n",
      "handed shot. Try all three and after a week you will tell me which one is the best for you,\n",
      "and whether you want to play with two hands or one hand.’ Exactly a week later, Djokovic\n",
      "came up to her unprompted, saying, ‘A week has passed and I’d like to explain to you – I’d\n",
      "like to play the backhand with two hands.’ She told him that was OK, as long as he stuck to\n",
      "a one-handed backhand slice and worked on it as a tool to get him to the net. He said he\n",
      "felt his backhands were much stronger with two hands than with one, so she said, ‘OK,\n",
      "we’ll go to work on that.’ They then worked very slowly without any pressure from Gencic,\n",
      "but she found him so intelligent and able to learn that he picked up the two-handed\n",
      "backhand very quickly.\n",
      "One of Djokovic’s principal attributes is his footwork, and he was complimented on that\n",
      "from the beginning. Gencic said she recognised from day one that he was a good skier,\n",
      "something she could also claim for herself, so essentially she taught him to adapt the basic\n",
      "flexibility \n",
      "in the ankles and legs that are core features for the skier to his tennis game. That\n",
      "even allowed him to slide on hard courts, something that’s a common feature today but\n",
      "was very rare then.\n",
      "Another feature of Gencic’s coaching was that she tried to link it with the heroes her kids\n",
      "were seeing on television. She asked Djokovic what appealed to him when he saw the\n",
      "likes of Pete Sampras, Stefan Edberg and Andre Agassi playing in the biggest tennis\n",
      "arenas. On one occasion Djokovic said he wanted to play Sampras’s running down-the-\n",
      "line forehand, so Gencic said she’d teach him. He wanted to serve and volley like Edberg,\n",
      "so she taught him that (and was a little aggrieved that he doesn’t do that much of it as a\n",
      "professional). And when he said he wanted to hit Agassi’s forehand, Gencic told him to\n",
      "watch where Agassi was standing during rallies. ‘Agassi stands inside the baseline,’ she\n",
      "said, ‘so I taught him to stay on or inside the baseline. This was important because he was\n",
      "very little and didn’t have much power, so he had to take the ball early and go forward, with\n",
      "a very fast follow-through. He looked at Agassi, and started to play that way. That was\n",
      "good, because he didn’t have much power so he had to finish points much sooner than\n",
      "you think. I told him not to get involved in long rallies – when you get a shorter ball, go for\n",
      "it.’\n",
      "Djokovic also had very good volleys but was reluctant to make great use of them. He\n",
      "once told her, ‘Jeca, you want me to play volleys, but when I go to the net I feel like I’m in a\n",
      "battlefield facing a thousand bombs.’\n",
      "Another observation Gencic made about the young Novak was that he never once said\n",
      "he was tired. In fact, he was more likely to ask to stay another hour at the end of the\n",
      "programmed practice period. ‘They were all playing four hours in the morning,’ she said of\n",
      "her camps in Kopaonik, ‘then two hours off and then two hours more in the afternoon – so\n",
      "six hours including two hours of fitness work. We did it every day except when it was\n",
      "raining.’\n",
      "And he never tired mentally. Whenever they finished a practice session, Gencic knew\n",
      "the boy would ask her something about what they were doing. At one stage she said to\n",
      "him, ‘Novak, I have two university degrees – I think I now have a third degree because of\n",
      "all your questions I’ve answered!’\n",
      "Gencic even claimed she had done her best to make him taller. ‘He was very late in\n",
      "growing,’ she observed.\n",
      "I read physiology books and asked people which exercises they could do to make a\n",
      "boy taller. And I found nine exercises every day, three times a day, and you will be\n",
      "taller than you would have been. They’re very easy but you must really work at them; if\n",
      "you don’t work, you don’t get anywhere. I worked on fitness but only on the tennis\n",
      "court, only on flexibility and agility, speed off the mark. I never worked on power with\n",
      "him, and no long-distance running. When you’re through puberty, you can start to work\n",
      "on power and your musculature will be long, which gives them flexibility and you can\n",
      "then work on the strength. But I wasn’t coaching him by then.\n",
      "As the months went by, word spread that this was a boy worth watching. Part of that word\n",
      "was spread by the boy himself. At seven he was invited on to a national television\n",
      "programme where children interview children – appearing with the peak of his cap turned\n",
      "to the back, he turned in a very cocksure performance that included the prediction that he\n",
      "would be No. 1 in the world. The clip is still available on the Internet, and even if you don’t\n",

      "The first came at the 2008 Australian Open, when his family were cheering a little too\n",
      "loudly for many people’s liking. Djokovic picked up on this and muttered something to his\n",

      "seems to know, but it was noted for the significance of him calming the cheerleaders. The\n",

      "less subtle – in \n",

      "in no uncertain terms to leave, an instruction witnessed by several members of the media.\n",
      "Srdjan duly did leave and was seen strolling down the river bank a short while later,\n",
      "smoking a big cigar. The third came at Wimbledon in 2009 when Djokovic was playing\n",
      "(and losing to) Tommy Haas. Djokovic asked his complete entourage, including Srdjan, to\n",
      "leave the players box. Only his uncle Goran returned later in the match. When asked to\n",
      "explain what had happened, Goran’s only comment was that this was a family matter and\n",

      "incidents to have been witnessed but he would never say or do anything that would\n",
      "humiliate his father, or indeed any member of his family, in public.\n",
      "There’s one other person in the Srdjan Djokovic story whose role is crucial because it’s\n",

      "perspective of the time, it was a very smart move and there was no question Djokovic was\n",
      "walking right into a winning culture.\n",
      "Ljubicic was having the year of his life – he’d started it by very nearly beating the\n",
      "undisputed world No. 1 Roger Federer in three finals and had gone on to beat the US\n",
      "Davis Cup dream team of Andre Agassi, Andy Roddick and the Bryan twins almost single-\n",
      "handedly in Los Angeles in the Davis Cup first round (he needed Mario Ancic’s help in the\n",
      "doubles but it was very much Ljubicic’s tie). In those first few months of 2005, it was easy\n",
      "to make the case that Ljubicic was effectively the world’s second-best player behind\n",
      "Federer.\n",
      "Amit Naor, the Israeli agent who had signed up Djokovic, was also Ljubicic’s agent. He,\n",
      "Piatti, Ljubicic and Djokovic all sat down and \n",
      "worked out that they could work together. ‘I\n",
      "never had a problem with Riccardo working with other players,’ says Ljubicic. ‘I just don’t\n",
      "mind it, I’ve never felt that I need a coach 24/7, I just needed certain things. The way\n",
      "Riccardo works is not to tell you what you need to do but to explain things and get you to\n",
      "understand, so there’s always a time when you need to sit back and work out all the\n",
      "information and, once you understand, you are your own man, you make decisions, and\n",
      "that makes you a better player.’\n",
      "It was easy for Ljubicic to be relaxed about the arrangement because he was the senior\n",
      "player. ‘It is really important within a team to know who is No. 1 priority and who is No. 2,’\n",
      "he says, ‘because you cannot coach two top players. The perfect combination is one top\n",
      "player and then a younger player who can learn from the top guy, possibly already ranked\n",
      "high enough that they can play the same tournaments, so in that case it works without any\n",
      "problems. It does take some understanding by the younger player.’\n",
      "Logically all fine and dandy, but what happens when the two players come up against\n",
      "each other? This is a perennial problem for the coaches hired by sportswear companies\n",
      "who suddenly find themselves with two players they coach going head-to-head – in that\n",
      "case, the coach generally doesn’t sit in the stadium. That was Piatti’s response when\n",
      "Ljubicic and Djokovic played each other in the Croatian capital Zagreb in February 2006.\n",
      "He opted to watch the match on television. It was Djokovic’s first tour-level semi-final and\n",
      "he took the first set on the tie-break, before losing 6–7, 6–3, 6–4. ‘I remember it was\n",
      "mentally really difficult,’ Ljubicic recalls, ‘but at the end of the day, it’s a tennis match and\n",
      "you have to adapt.’\n",
      "Djokovic spent nearly a year working with Piatti and Ljubicic. In that time he made\n",
      "modest progress, rising from 94 in the rankings to 63. But it was behind the scenes that a\n",
      "lot of progress was being made that would help him later.\n",

      "the ball in a strange way,’ the Italian says. ‘I can’t remember what was strange about it but I\n",
      "was aware that Goran Ivanisevic had had some problems with his eyes, and when he\n",
      "sorted them out, he won Wimbledon. So I asked Novak if he’d ever had his eyes tested. He\n",
      "said he hadn’t, so I suggested that when he next went back to Serbia he get them checked\n",
      "out. He did and found there was a serious problem which needed correcting.’ Since then,\n",
      "Djokovic has worn contact lenses and occasionally some stylish glasses in off-court\n",
      "situations. Also early on, Ljubicic suggested to Djokovic that he change the strings he was\n",
      "using. He was using synthetic on both his main strings and his cross strings. Ljubicic said\n",
      "to Djokovic, ‘Listen, all the best players except Rafa use a combination of synthetic and\n",
      "gut!’ The Croat suggested Djokovic use a hybrid of gut and synthetic and choose a better\n",
      "quality of synthetic string than the one he was using. Djokovic took the advice.\n",
      "And in May 2006 Djokovic had a foot injury. Naor sought help from an Israeli\n",
      "physiotherapist Rafi Virshuvski, who in turn sounded out a contact, Tamir Kfir. Kfir is a life-\n",
      "long amateur tennis player who made his professional name in making orthotic insoles\n",
      "and orthopaedic prostheses. After analysing Djokovic’s movement, Kfir decided to design\n",

      "to get the ball back into play, the significance of Kfir’s analysis and solution can’t be\n",
      "overstated. After beating Roger Federer and Andy Murray in straight sets in back-to-back\n",
      "matches to win the 2011 Australian Open with some outstanding footwork, Djokovic threw\n",
      "his racket, his shirt, his socks and his shoes to the crowd – but before \n",
      "throwing his shoes,\n",
      "he took out the orthotics. When asked whether he had special insoles, he said, ‘Yes.\n",
      "That’s the secret to my footwork. You got me there!’\n",
      "Ljubicic recalls,\n",
      "What struck me is that he really knew what he needed. He had physical needs, which\n",
      "he recognised. We shared a fitness coach but very quickly he figured out he needed a\n",
      "different approach to fitness work. The fitness guy we worked with, Salvador Sosa, is\n",
      "based on pure strength, explosive strength and power, whereas Novak always felt he\n",
      "needed to be more flexible, more soft, which you see on court. He was always about\n",
      "stretching, how flexible he is, and Sosa wasn’t working like that. I think he was really\n",
      "mature really soon. I think every tennis player reaches the moment where he becomes\n",
      "a man and, to him, it happened really quickly. With me, it happened when I was 23 or\n",
      "24, with him it happened when he was 17 or 18, which is why he went up so quickly.\n",
      "He wasn’t really a joker. He wanted to become as good as he can. Once he realised\n",
      "who he really is and he was going in the right direction, he relaxed more and let go\n",
      "more that side, which is his personality. But when he was younger, he was more\n",
      "professional in the sense that he wouldn’t waste time on unnecessary things. He was\n",
      "100 per cent focused on what he wanted to do.\n",
      "Piatti says, ‘It was very easy to see the potential. When we started working, I noted his\n",
      "flexibility, his attitude on court, his technique, his mentality. He was so focused and so\n",
      "determined. Yes, he was young but in some ways very mature. He was also ready for the\n",
      "top level. Technically he was ready, physically he was good. I felt sure he was a No. 1 of\n",
      "the future; his parents had built him in the correct way for that role.’\n",
      "Such determination and focus is all well and good but it still needs to be channelled in\n",
      "the right direction. Ljubicic believes Piatti did that channelling. ‘Riccardo helped Novak\n",
      "grow up. There were moments when he was lost. Now that he’s king of the world, it looks\n",
      "like he always knew what he was doing but, back then, it wasn’t really like that. He was a\n",
      "character. He travelled with a friend to Australia and Riccardo said maybe that was not the\n",
      "right thing to do. That was Riccardo’s way; he tried to think what was right for Novak.\n",
      "Novak was 18, he had to explore the world, but it didn’t take him long to work it out. I think\n",
      "he learned about himself. He learned more and more what he needed, he gained from the\n",
      "experience of being close to a top player, because I was No. 3 in the world at that time, so\n",
      "he could see what was needed to get there. He never needed to talk about forehands and\n",
      "backhands, though we did work a lot on his serve – he wasn’t really using his serve and,\n",
      "while we were working together, Riccardo and I were giving him tips.’\n",
      "The link with Ljubicic is an interesting one for the subject of nationality. In 2005 Ljubicic\n",
      "cemented his place as a national sporting icon for the new Balkan state of Croatia, when\n",

      "Cup). But one other thing binds them – they were both sounded out about playing for a\n",
      "different country.\n",

      "At the start of 2009 he had switched racket companies, moving from the Wilson frame\n",

      "him several months to be completely comfortable with his new racket, and during those\n",
      "months there were plenty who were happy to suggest he had gone for the money over the\n",
      "best interests of his tennis. For him, that time was an investment in adjusting to a weapon\n",
      "with which he could conquer the world.\n",
      "And yet by the middle of 2009, he himself and those around him were beginning to\n",
      "wonder where the next surge was going to come from. In May his ranking had slipped to\n",
      "fourth as Andy Murray joined the big three, which meant he was seeded fourth for the\n",
      "French Open. He lost to Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round of the French and to\n",

      "‘THIS IS WHAT I’M BORN FOR’\n",
      "I\n",
      "n the press conference that followed his Wimbledon victory in July 2011, Djokovic was\n",
      "asked to comment on a statement his mother had made: that winning the Davis Cup for\n",
      "Serbia seven months earlier taught him to play without fear. Djokovic replied, ‘Well, if my\n",
      "mother says that, then it’s like that. There is nothing else I can say. My mother knows me\n",
      "better than I know myself.’\n",
      "It’s easy to make the case that winning the Davis Cup freed up Djokovic and formed the\n",
      "missing piece in the jigsaw that allowed him to utterly dominate world tennis in 2011.\n",
      "Djokovic half-makes that argument himself. ‘The Davis Cup title came in the right moment,’\n",
      "he says. ‘I believe that title, that feeling of sharing one of the biggest titles in our sport with\n",
      "my team for our country, in our country, was one of the best feelings I experienced as a\n",
      "tennis player on the court. That was a great confidence boost and helped me to believe in\n",
      "myself, to believe more in my abilities on the court.’\n",
      "But that would be too simple an explanation for his \n",
      "annus mirabilis\n",
      " of 2011. There were\n",
      "several ‘last pieces of the jigsaw’, of which the gluten-free diet he discovered in mid-2010\n",
      "was certainly one (whether actual or only in the mind – the health professionals are divided\n",
      "but his belief in the gluten-free diet was clearly of huge significance to his well-being), and\n",
      "rediscovering the rhythm on his serve was another. To that can be added a whole range of\n",
      "little things, from the orthotics in his shoes to the calm but authoritative backroom team\n",
      "presided over by Marian Vajda. And at the age of 23, he had a greater wealth of\n",
      "experience, including a more mature relationship with his father that gave him the sense of\n",
      "being in control of his own life, rather than having it run for him.\n",
      "Yet it’s important to remember that there were people at the start of 2011 who felt\n",
      "Djokovic may have peaked. He had won the Australian Open at 20, but since then he had\n",
      "spent three years clearly behind Federer and Nadal at the top of the game. Coming from a\n",
      "country where team sports were valued more importantly than individual sports, his biggest\n",
      "priority – so the hypothesis went – may well have been the Davis Cup. And with Andy\n",
      "Murray establishing himself as a member of the elite, there was no guarantee that Djokovic\n",
      "had a natural right to ascend to the world No. 1’s throne when the fortunes of the great duo\n",
      "began to wane. So while it may look, with the benefit of hindsight, like the most natural\n",
      "progression, Djokovic’s wonderful 2011 was by no means a given at the start of it.\n",
      "He was, perhaps, a shade lucky in not having to face Nadal at Melbourne Park. Nadal\n",
      "went to Australia looking to hold all four major titles concurrently but he was undone by his\n",
      "left hamstring in the quarter-finals. Facing his compatriot David Ferrer, who has always\n",
      "seemed to lack belief against Nadal in Grand Slam matches, Nadal called for the trainer\n",
      "after three games and he left the court for treatment. Although he finished the match, it was\n",
      "clear he couldn’t move at anything like his normal level, and Ferrer’s \n",
      "straight-sets win took\n",
      "place in a somewhat bemused atmosphere, where no one at Melbourne Park could quite\n",
      "take what they were seeing at face value. In his post-match press conference, Nadal\n",
      "refused to talk about any injury, except for one hint that he couldn’t move that well. It was\n",
      "an approach that divided the tennis community into those who felt it was all rather a fake\n",
      "and those who respected the dignity with which he refused to blame an injury for fear of\n",
      "undermining one of the best results of a fellow professional’s career.\n",
      "Perhaps Djokovic’s biggest victory at that tournament was in beating Federer in the\n",
      "semi-finals. Thought of very much as a 50:50 beforehand, Djokovic outplayed Federer with\n",
      "his superb footwork. Federer was starting to put into practice the coaching of Paul\n",
      "Annacone, notably Annacone’s suggestion that he play closer to the baseline to rob his\n",
      "opponent of vital split seconds. But every time Federer drove Djokovic wide, the Serb was\n",
      "there with blistering groundstrokes that would be anatomically impossible for players with\n",
      "lesser ankles, and the Serb won in three tight but clear sets. Interestingly, Djokovic favours\n",
      "his left foot when kicking a football, so it could be that he has an unusually strong left foot\n",
      "which allows him a firmer base than other players have for hitting big backhands when at\n",
      "full stretch.\n",
      "He lost just nine games against Murray in the final. It’s possible the real story of that final\n",
      "has never been fully told. Just before the walk on court, a tournament official wished\n",
      "Murray well, to which Murray muttered misanthropically, ‘Hopefully, I can get through it.’\n",
      "The Scot had been suffering from back problems throughout that fortnight, and while it’s\n",
      "hard to know what exactly to read into his rather pained body language when he’s losing\n",
      "(until recently, Murray seldom lost a match without looking as if he was suffering greatly),\n",
      "he certainly didn’t seem to be at full fitness. And there was almost a sense of relief for\n",
      "Murray that he hadn’t lost \n",
      "embarrassingly. Invited on a couple of subsequent occasions to\n",
      "say whether there was anything hindering him that day, Murray has always denied it, but\n",
      "Nadal may have established a convention among the top players: not to blame an injury for\n",
      "a defeat to an opponent they respect.\n",
      "And maybe Murray was beaten, at least in part, by the growing realisation that Djokovic\n",
      "was something of a born-again player. Six months later, Djokovic was to say, ‘After the\n",
      "Davis Cup win I was full of life, full of energy, eager to come back to the tennis court, eager\n",
      "to play some more, win some other tournaments. In a sentence, I lost my fear. I believed in\n",
      "my abilities more than ever. Australia was one of the best tournaments I played in my life.’\n",
      "Yet the biggest obstacle to Djokovic dominating tennis was the fact that he lacked self-\n",
      "belief against Federer and Nadal. ‘I had too much respect for them,’ he has since admitted.\n",
      "He had no difficulty believing he could beat everyone else, but there was a psychological\n",
      "block against the top two – certainly against Nadal.\n",
      "Given that admission, perhaps the real work in the \n",
      "annus mirabilis\n",
      " was done in the finals\n",
      "of the four ATP Masters-1000 tournaments leading up to the French Open. Over more than\n",
      "a decade, the ATP has done its best to market its top nine tour-level tournaments as a\n",
      "special series, a bit like the European Champions League in football, and they do stand\n",
      "out from the rest of the 60-odd tour-level events that make up the men’s professional circuit.\n",
      "But they have always struggled to get close to the four majors, and in terms of financial\n",
      "turnover the gap is getting bigger, not smaller. Yet for Djokovic in 2011, they were more\n",
      "than just warm-up events. In the finals of Indian Wells, Miami, Madrid and Rome, he\n",
      "prepared the ground for his final climb to the top.\n",
      "In the first half of 2011 there was a strange triangle at the top of the men’s game. Nadal\n",
      "clearly had the edge over Federer; in fact, Federer, for all his dominance, has not beaten\n",
      "Nadal at a major \n",
      "since the 2007 Wimbledon final. Federer still felt he could beat Djokovic,\n",
      "though Djokovic’s emphatic win at the Australian Open had made their rivalry very much\n",
      "even. So being able to beat Nadal was the key to Djokovic’s assault on the summit.\n",
      "His victory in the final of Indian Wells was a boost, but it’s hard to read too much into\n",
      "results at Indian Wells. Although the tennis facility built by the former player Charlie\n",
      "Pasarell is quite superb, the setting is a slightly rarefied one, in that it’s part of a retirement\n",
      "community, making the average age of the spectators higher than elsewhere on the tour. In\n",
      "addition, the ball can sometimes fly in the Californian desert, so freak results can never be\n",

      "of Dubai a fortnight after Melbourne), but at the time, Djokovic just looked like a player in\n",
      "form.\n",
      "When he beat Nadal in Miami on a final set tie-break, the tennis world sat up a little\n",
      "more. Beating the clear world No. 1 twice in successive finals was becoming a statement,\n",
      "but Nadal’s best surface was still to come.\n",
      "Djokovic skipped Monte Carlo, but after picking up a second title at his own tournament\n",
      "in Belgrade, he played the back-to-back Masters events in Madrid and Rome, the home\n",
      "straight of the run-up to the French Open. By now people were talking about his amazing\n",
      "unbeaten streak. Going into Madrid it was 28 matches in the year and 30 since his last\n",
      "defeat (to Federer at the ATP Finals). When he beat Nadal 7–5, 6–4 in the final, the tennis\n",
      "world was sitting bolt upright – it was his first ever victory against the Spaniard on clay and\n",
      "Nadal had been beaten in a clay-court final for only the third time. But again there were\n",
      "slightly mitigating circumstances. Nadal has never been totally comfortable in Madrid,\n",
      "where the altitude makes the ball fly more \n",
      "quickly through the air, and the Caja Magica\n",
      "tennis stadium often seems to help those players who play best on hard courts. That’s why\n",
      "the real damage Djokovic did to the Nadal psyche took place in Rome. This had been\n",
      "something of a stronghold for Nadal – he had won back-to-back five-set finals in the days\n",
      "when the final was played over the full distance, and the conditions were much more\n",
      "similar to Roland Garros than Madrid had been. So when Djokovic beat Nadal 6–4, 6–4 in\n",
      "the final, he suddenly became a joint favourite for Paris.\n",
      "What was Djokovic doing? He and his team had identified that Nadal’s incredibly heavy\n",
      "topspin allowed him to play relatively safe, in the sense that he didn’t need to hit into the\n",
      "last half-metre of the court – a three-quarter-length shot with heavy topspin that made the\n",
      "ball almost explode off the surface could often do the same damage. So Djokovic stepped\n",
      "in to make use of the shorter ball. He had always been a player to play largely on his\n",
      "baseline but now he stepped even further into the court to take the ball early and rob Nadal\n",
      "of vital seconds. It was a high-risk strategy, as it made him vulnerable to having to play\n",
      "balls off his shoelaces when they were hit deep, but with Nadal’s game built around\n",
      "phenomenal speed and retrieving ability, it was worth the chance to rush the Spaniard.\n",
      "And once the strategy began to work, the psychological dividend kicked in, as Nadal felt\n",
      "the need to hit deeper when he got a softer ball, and frequently overhit.\n",
      "By the time the Roland Garros semi-finals came round, Djokovic’s unbeaten streak was\n",
      "up to 45 matches. But on a glorious if gusty spring day in Paris, the streak came to an end\n",
      "on one of the best days of tennis played in the history of the sport.\n",
