      "September 2010.\n",
      "I was in Belgrade for the first time, covering the Davis Cup semi-final between Serbia\n",
      "and the Czech Republic. I arrived on the Wednesday evening, and when I hooked up with\n",

      "block from the Beogradska Arena, the 17,000-seater indoor stadium that had become the\n",
      "spiritual home of Serbian tennis.\n",
      "The following morning I had to interview Djokovic for television, and while we were\n",
      "waiting for the cameraman to get set up, I told him that I’d eaten at his restaurant the night\n",
      "before. He asked me what I thought of it. I hesitated, trying to think of the politest way to say\n",
      "that the food was very good (it was) but it was rather a long time coming (I’ve since learned\n",
      "that you do wait a long time for your food in Serbian restaurants and Novak’s isn’t\n",

      "getting there but it’s slow and we’ve a long way to go.’\n",
      "What struck me about his response was that it encapsulated the \n",
      "dual role Djokovic\n",
      "plays. He’s totally comfortable outside Serbia, fully integrated into the western European\n",
      "and North American culture where smoking in public places is now unacceptable\n",

      "different register – he’s a bit more jingoistic, happy to join in with Serbian songs and\n",
      "cultural rituals, even a bit of blatant nationalism. That, at least, is my impression. He\n",
      "himself denies it, saying he always acts the same: ‘I always try to be respectful and kind to\n",
      "everyone no matter what country they come from, or where I am on the map. That applies\n",
      "to my compatriots, too.’ That may indeed be his intention, though I stand by my sense that\n",
      "there are subtle changes he makes when he’s in his homeland.\n",
      "That brief exchange wasn’t the genesis of this book but it played an important role when\n",
      "John Blake Publishing came to me in 2012 and asked if I would write a biography of\n",
      "Djokovic. My first step was to approach Djokovic’s agent and see if an authorised\n",
      "biography or ghosted autobiography might be on the cards. I was told that neither was an\n",

      "At that time, tennis was an amateur sport and Yugoslavia was a country with a\n",
      "collectivist (state-controlled) economy. Gencic had everything paid for but was expected to\n",
      "give something back, in the form of helping youngsters. She therefore began informal\n",
      "coaching well before her tournament-playing days ended in 1976.\n",
      "The restrictions of Tito’s Yugoslavia in the 1950s and 1960s meant that only the best two\n",

      "anything but neither did I. So I said they had to go to find some sponsors. They did find the\n",

      "he sometimes found a knife at his throat. The only way out was to take out a second loan to\n",

      "These days, while Djokovic enjoys a very high standing among his compatriots, the\n",
      "same cannot be said for the rest of his family. His father and uncle have made enemies,\n",

      "People who criticise his parents don’t know or don’t want to know the full story of the\n",
      "Djokovic family from the beginning. They see only money now; they think he [Srdjan]\n",
      "is arrogant. The family were very friendly until they needed money for Novak. That\n",
      "was terrible. They knew that Novak would be the best, but how do you find money?\n",
      "They went out every day looking for money. Srdjan did get very angry but then he\n",
      "knocked on every door, including the government’s, asking for help – he constantly\n",
      "came up against ‘Who is this boy?’, ‘We don’t have money for this little boy.’ Now they\n",
      "like to say, ‘We made him.’ I’m very happy for Srdjan to claim the credit for it because\n",
      "what he did allowed Novak to go to tournaments. The Djokovic family has had a\n",
      "terrible life until now. These days they have the money but I’m not interested how\n",
      "they’re living. I’m only interested in how Novak and [his younger brothers] Marko and\n",
      "Djordje are doing.\n",
      "The work developing Novak Djokovic into a world-class tennis player progressed slowly\n",
      "but surely. He learned quickly but was a small boy, so Gencic sometimes had to wait for\n",
      "his body to catch up before she could move forward.\n",
      "Having grown up in the pre-Connors and pre-Evert era, Gencic’s natural inclination was\n",
      "to teach the one-handed backhand. So for the first year or so of his tennis career, Djokovic\n",
      "hit his backhand one-handed. Then one day, when he was about six and a half, he walked\n",
      "up to Gencic and asked very politely, ‘Please, Jeca, can I try to play the backhand with two\n",
      "hands?’ Gencic replied, ‘Of course, why not, but first of all I must explain to you how you\n",
      "must hold the racket for a two-handed backhand because you have three options: a left-\n",
      "handed forehand, a one-handed backhand with the second hand, or a genuinely two-\n",
      "handed shot. Try all three and after a week you will tell me which one is the best for you,\n",
      "and whether you want to play with two hands or one hand.’ Exactly a week later, Djokovic\n",
      "came up to her unprompted, saying, ‘A week has passed and I’d like to explain to you – I’d\n",
      "like to play the backhand with two hands.’ She told him that was OK, as long as he stuck to\n",
      "a one-handed backhand slice and worked on it as a tool to get him to the net. He said he\n",
      "felt his backhands were much stronger with two hands than with one, so she said, ‘OK,\n",
      "we’ll go to work on that.’ They then worked very slowly without any pressure from Gencic,\n",
      "but she found him so intelligent and able to learn that he picked up the two-handed\n",
      "backhand very quickly.\n",
      "One of Djokovic’s principal attributes is his footwork, and he was complimented on that\n",
      "from the beginning. Gencic said she recognised from day one that he was a good skier,\n",
      "something she could also claim for herself, so essentially she taught him to adapt the basic\n",
      "flexibility \n",
      "in the ankles and legs that are core features for the skier to his tennis game. That\n",
      "even allowed him to slide on hard courts, something that’s a common feature today but\n",
      "was very rare then.\n",
      "Another feature of Gencic’s coaching was that she tried to link it with the heroes her kids\n",
      "were seeing on television. She asked Djokovic what appealed to him when he saw the\n",
      "likes of Pete Sampras, Stefan Edberg and Andre Agassi playing in the biggest tennis\n",
      "arenas. On one occasion Djokovic said he wanted to play Sampras’s running down-the-\n",
      "line forehand, so Gencic said she’d teach him. He wanted to serve and volley like Edberg,\n",
      "so she taught him that (and was a little aggrieved that he doesn’t do that much of it as a\n",
      "professional). And when he said he wanted to hit Agassi’s forehand, Gencic told him to\n",
      "watch where Agassi was standing during rallies. ‘Agassi stands inside the baseline,’ she\n",
      "said, ‘so I taught him to stay on or inside the baseline. This was important because he was\n",
      "very little and didn’t have much power, so he had to take the ball early and go forward, with\n",
      "a very fast follow-through. He looked at Agassi, and started to play that way. That was\n",
      "good, because he didn’t have much power so he had to finish points much sooner than\n",
      "you think. I told him not to get involved in long rallies – when you get a shorter ball, go for\n",
      "it.’\n",
      "Djokovic also had very good volleys but was reluctant to make great use of them. He\n",
      "once told her, ‘Jeca, you want me to play volleys, but when I go to the net I feel like I’m in a\n",
      "battlefield facing a thousand bombs.’\n",
      "Another observation Gencic made about the young Novak was that he never once said\n",
      "he was tired. In fact, he was more likely to ask to stay another hour at the end of the\n",
      "programmed practice period. ‘They were all playing four hours in the morning,’ she said of\n",
      "her camps in Kopaonik, ‘then two hours off and then two hours more in the afternoon – so\n",
      "six hours including two hours of fitness work. We did it every day except when it was\n",
      "raining.’\n",
      "And he never tired mentally. Whenever they finished a practice session, Gencic knew\n",
      "the boy would ask her something about what they were doing. At one stage she said to\n",
      "him, ‘Novak, I have two university degrees – I think I now have a third degree because of\n",
      "all your questions I’ve answered!’\n",
      "Gencic even claimed she had done her best to make him taller. ‘He was very late in\n",
      "growing,’ she observed.\n",
      "I read physiology books and asked people which exercises they could do to make a\n",
      "boy taller. And I found nine exercises every day, three times a day, and you will be\n",
      "taller than you would have been. They’re very easy but you must really work at them; if\n",
      "you don’t work, you don’t get anywhere. I worked on fitness but only on the tennis\n",
      "court, only on flexibility and agility, speed off the mark. I never worked on power with\n",
      "him, and no long-distance running. When you’re through puberty, you can start to work\n",
      "on power and your musculature will be long, which gives them flexibility and you can\n",
      "then work on the strength. But I wasn’t coaching him by then.\n",
      "As the months went by, word spread that this was a boy worth watching. Part of that word\n",
      "was spread by the boy himself. At seven he was invited on to a national television\n",
      "programme where children interview children – appearing with the peak of his cap turned\n",

      "Federer.\n",
      "Amit Naor, the Israeli agent who had signed up Djokovic, was also Ljubicic’s agent. He,\n",

      "never had a problem with Riccardo working with other players,’ says Ljubicic. ‘I just don’t\n",
      "mind it, I’ve never felt that I need a coach 24/7, I just needed certain things. The way\n",
      "Riccardo works is not to tell you what you need to do but to explain things and get you to\n",
      "understand, so there’s always a time when you need to sit back and work out all the\n",
      "information and, once you understand, you are your own man, you make decisions, and\n",
      "that makes you a better player.’\n",
      "It was easy for Ljubicic to be relaxed about the arrangement because he was the senior\n",
      "player. ‘It is really important within a team to know who is No. 1 priority and who is No. 2,’\n",
      "he says, ‘because you cannot coach two top players. The perfect combination is one top\n",
      "player and then a younger player who can learn from the top guy, possibly already ranked\n",
      "high enough that they can play the same tournaments, so in that case it works without any\n",
      "problems. It does take some understanding by the younger player.’\n",
      "Logically all fine and dandy, but what happens when the two players come up against\n",
      "each other? This is a perennial problem for the coaches hired by sportswear companies\n",
      "who suddenly find themselves with two players they coach going head-to-head – in that\n",
      "case, the coach generally doesn’t sit in the stadium. That was Piatti’s response when\n",
      "Ljubicic and Djokovic played each other in the Croatian capital Zagreb in February 2006.\n",
      "He opted to watch the match on television. It was Djokovic’s first tour-level semi-final and\n",
      "he took the first set on the tie-break, before losing 6–7, 6–3, 6–4. ‘I remember it was\n",
      "mentally really difficult,’ Ljubicic recalls, ‘but at the end of the day, it’s a tennis match and\n",
      "you have to adapt.’\n",
      "Djokovic spent nearly a year working with Piatti and Ljubicic. In that time he made\n",
      "modest progress, rising from 94 in the rankings to 63. But it was behind the scenes that a\n",
      "lot of progress was being made that would help him later.\n",

      "the ball in a strange way,’ the Italian says. ‘I can’t remember what was strange about it but I\n",
      "was aware that Goran Ivanisevic had had some problems with his eyes, and when he\n",
      "sorted them out, he won Wimbledon. So I asked Novak if he’d ever had his eyes tested. He\n",
      "said he hadn’t, so I suggested that when he next went back to Serbia he get them checked\n",
      "out. He did and found there was a serious problem which needed correcting.’ Since then,\n",
      "Djokovic has worn contact lenses and occasionally some stylish glasses in off-court\n",
      "situations. Also early on, Ljubicic suggested to Djokovic that he change the strings he was\n",
      "using. He was using synthetic on both his main strings and his cross strings. Ljubicic said\n",

      "gut!’ The Croat suggested Djokovic use a hybrid of gut and synthetic and choose a better\n",
      "quality of synthetic string than the one he was using. Djokovic took the advice.\n",
      "And in May 2006 Djokovic had a foot injury. Naor sought help from an Israeli\n",
      "physiotherapist Rafi Virshuvski, who in turn sounded out a contact, Tamir Kfir. Kfir is a life-\n",
      "long amateur tennis player who made his professional name in making orthotic insoles\n",

      "overstated. After beating Roger Federer and Andy Murray in straight sets in back-to-back\n",
      "matches to win the 2011 Australian Open with some outstanding footwork, Djokovic threw\n",
      "his racket, his shirt, his socks and his shoes to the crowd – but before \n",
      "throwing his shoes,\n",
      "he took out the orthotics. When asked whether he had special insoles, he said, ‘Yes.\n",
      "That’s the secret to my footwork. You got me there!’\n",
      "Ljubicic recalls,\n",
      "What struck me is that he really knew what he needed. He had physical needs, which\n",
      "he recognised. We shared a fitness coach but very quickly he figured out he needed a\n",
      "different approach to fitness work. The fitness guy we worked with, Salvador Sosa, is\n",
      "based on pure strength, explosive strength and power, whereas Novak always felt he\n",
      "needed to be more flexible, more soft, which you see on court. He was always about\n",
      "stretching, how flexible he is, and Sosa wasn’t working like that. I think he was really\n",
      "mature really soon. I think every tennis player reaches the moment where he becomes\n",
      "a man and, to him, it happened really quickly. With me, it happened when I was 23 or\n",
      "24, with him it happened when he was 17 or 18, which is why he went up so quickly.\n",
      "He wasn’t really a joker. He wanted to become as good as he can. Once he realised\n",
      "who he really is and he was going in the right direction, he relaxed more and let go\n",
      "more that side, which is his personality. But when he was younger, he was more\n",
      "professional in the sense that he wouldn’t waste time on unnecessary things. He was\n",
      "100 per cent focused on what he wanted to do.\n",
      "Piatti says, ‘It was very easy to see the potential. When we started working, I noted his\n",
      "flexibility, his attitude on court, his technique, his mentality. He was so focused and so\n",
      "determined. Yes, he was young but in some ways very mature. He was also ready for the\n",
      "top level. Technically he was ready, physically he was good. I felt sure he was a No. 1 of\n",
      "the future; his parents had built him in the correct way for that role.’\n",
      "Such determination and focus is all well and good but it still needs to be channelled in\n",
      "the right direction. Ljubicic believes Piatti did that channelling. ‘Riccardo helped Novak\n",
      "grow up. There were moments when he was lost. Now that he’s king of the world, it looks\n",
      "like he always knew what he was doing but, back then, it wasn’t really like that. He was a\n",
      "character. He travelled with a friend to Australia and Riccardo said maybe that was not the\n",
      "right thing to do. That was Riccardo’s way; he tried to think what was right for Novak.\n",
      "Novak was 18, he had to explore the world, but it didn’t take him long to work it out. I think\n",
      "he learned about himself. He learned more and more what he needed, he gained from the\n",
      "experience of being close to a top player, because I was No. 3 in the world at that time, so\n",
      "he could see what was needed to get there. He never needed to talk about forehands and\n",
      "backhands, though we did work a lot on his serve – he wasn’t really using his serve and,\n",
      "while we were working together, Riccardo and I were giving him tips.’\n",

      "Cup). But one other thing binds them – they were both sounded out about playing for a\n",
      "different country.\n",
      "Ljubicic escaped the carnage of the disintegrating Yugoslavia, fleeing his home in the\n",

       " 'INTRODUCTION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nV\\nukovar, Srebrenica, Mostar, Banja Luka. Smallish towns in what was once Yugoslavia,\\nwhich became nightly recurring names on international television news bulletins in the\\n1990s. Equally recurring names were those of Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman, Alja\\nIzetbegovic, Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic – the leading protagonists from that same\\nconflict, the four wars that characterised the break-up of Yugoslavia. The reconstruction of\\nEurope after the Second World War based on economic interdependence was supposed\\nto prevent future wars in Europe. But 46 years after the end of the war and 34 years after\\nthe founding of what is today the European Union, neighbour turned against neighbour in\\nthe most appalling bloodbath, which a United Nations tribunal said included genocide. All\\non European soil.\\nIt’s tempting to see wars as neat packages of time – like the world stopped between\\n1914 and 1918, and stopped again from 1939 to 1945. It’s never like that. Life goes on,\\ndespite the fears and privations \\nof war. People learn to survive, they educate their kids,\\nand some of those kids can still learn to dance, or play a musical instrument or a sport the\\nway they would have done during peacetime.\\nAs such, it should surprise no one that out of the wreckage of war-torn Yugoslavia\\nshould come some gifted athletes. But that six world-class tennis players should come\\nfrom Serbia, a country of just 7.1 million inhabitants, 88,000 square kilometres and no real\\ntennis tradition, is something remarkable. And we are talking about six. Novak Djokovic,\\nAna Ivanovic, Jelena Jankovic and Nenad Zimonjic were all world-ranked No. 1 in the\\nspace of a few years: the first three in singles, Zimonjic in men’s doubles. Add to that\\nJanko Tipsarevic, who reached eighth and spent two years in the top 10, and Viktor\\nTroicki, who was once ranked 12th, and it is a remarkable generation, almost on a par with\\nthe Swedes, who defied their miniscule population to produce a phenomenal crop of tennis\\nplayers that dominated team tennis and many of the major titles from the mid-1970s to the\\nlate 1990s.\\nOf these six Serbs, Djokovic is by far the most successful. Ivanovic’s achievement of\\nwinning the 1998 French Open and reaching the top of the women’s rankings should not\\nbe underestimated but she held the top spot for only a few weeks and has never looked\\neven close to winning a second major since. She is a charming and stunningly good-\\nlooking ambassador for her country but her results limit how effective she can be. Jankovic\\nis one of only three women players to have topped the rankings without having won a\\nGrand Slam singles title – her achievement speaks for her phenomenal consistency in\\n2008–9, but she too has looked a long way from taking herself off that list in the intervening\\nyears.\\nBy contrast, Djokovic has notched up six Grand Slam titles and needs only the French\\nOpen to complete a career Grand Slam. More importantly, he has shown he is the equal of\\nRoger Federer and Rafael Nadal in having the charisma and gravitas to represent his\\nsport, and has set an example by his dignified and gracious behaviour. And that is of\\nmassive importance to his country. His career is moderately well documented and his\\nnatural charisma is enhanced by one or two of his sideshows – his impersonations of\\nfellow professionals, his habit of calling the trainer during matches (now largely extinct)\\nand his voluble father. But no one has yet set it against the background of his country’s\\nemergence from the horrors of the 1990s bloodshed. This book is an attempt to do that.',\n",
       " ' \\nIt would be tempting – though not entirely true – to say the seed for this book was sown in\\nSeptember 2010.\\nI was in Belgrade for the first time, covering the Davis Cup semi-final between Serbia\\nand the Czech Republic. I arrived on the Wednesday evening, and when I hooked up with\\nthe people I was working with, found that they’d arranged to eat at Novak’s, one of the two\\nrestaurants in Belgrade owned by Novak Djokovic. How appropriate – my first ever meal in\\nBelgrade at the restaurant of the man who was putting Serbia on the map! And just one\\nblock from the Beogradska Arena, the 17,000-seater indoor stadium that had become the\\nspiritual home of Serbian tennis.\\nThe following morning I had to interview Djokovic for television, and while we were\\nwaiting for the cameraman to get set up, I told him that I’d eaten at his restaurant the night\\nbefore. He asked me what I thought of it. I hesitated, trying to think of the politest way to say\\nthat the food was very good (it was) but it was rather a long time coming (I’ve since learned\\nthat you do wait a long time for your food in Serbian restaurants and Novak’s isn’t\\nparticularly slow). But I never got to say that because Djokovic interjected with ‘Don’t tell\\nme – it was too smoky, wasn’t it?’ I had to admit it was, to which he added, ‘Yes, we’re\\ngetting there but it’s slow and we’ve a long way to go.’\\nWhat struck me about his response was that it encapsulated the \\ndual role Djokovic\\nplays. He’s totally comfortable outside Serbia, fully integrated into the western European\\nand North American culture where smoking in public places is now unacceptable\\n(normally banned), where all good restaurants offer healthy options and where patriotism is\\nwelcomed but nationalism is viewed with suspicion, especially when it gets vociferous. Yet\\nhe’s also totally comfortable in his own country, even though he acts with a slightly\\ndifferent register – he’s a bit more jingoistic, happy to join in with Serbian songs and\\ncultural rituals, even a bit of blatant nationalism. That, at least, is my impression. He\\nhimself denies it, saying he always acts the same: ‘I always try to be respectful and kind to\\neveryone no matter what country they come from, or where I am on the map. That applies\\nto my compatriots, too.’ That may indeed be his intention, though I stand by my sense that\\nthere are subtle changes he makes when he’s in his homeland.\\nThat brief exchange wasn’t the genesis of this book but it played an important role when\\nJohn Blake Publishing came to me in 2012 and asked if I would write a biography of\\nDjokovic. My first step was to approach Djokovic’s agent and see if an authorised\\nbiography or ghosted autobiography might be on the cards. I was told that neither was an\\noption, as Djokovic wants to write his own book when his playing career ends. That left me\\nwith the option of an independent biography of Djokovic, or nothing. As I had written Roger\\nFederer’s biography on that basis and updated it several times, I had no particular desire to\\nwrite another straight tennis biography, so I told Blake I wasn’t up for the Djokovic book.\\nBlake’s staff came back saying they were particularly keen to have a book about\\nDjokovic, so would I reconsider? I thought about it and kept being struck by my realisation\\nabout how Djokovic spans these two cultures: the Serbian and the international. I’ve also\\nbeen struck by how little the western world understands about Serbia, so I went back to\\nBlake and offered them a book that was a mixture \\nof Djokovic’s own story and Serbia’s\\nstory. They jumped at the suggestion and this is that book.\\n \\nFor a book like this to work, the author needs a bit of good fortune and I had two distinct\\nstrokes of luck.\\nThe first came when I got an email from Chris Bowers. If this sounds like a bad case of',\n",
       " 'talking to myself, it isn’t. I have a namesake who used to work at the BBC at the same time\\nas I did and he contacted me confessing to a 20-year guilty conscience about having\\naccepted a dinner date from a female admirer who, it transpired, had heard my voice on the\\nradio, not his. I found that touching – and, no doubt, a little flattering – but more significant\\nwas his email address. I recognised that he worked for the British foreign ministry and,\\nthrough him, I was able to re-establish contact with a colleague of his and an old tennis-\\nplaying friend of mine, Mike Davenport. And Mike just happened to be the newly minted\\nBritish ambassador to Belgrade, who subsequently proved of immense help to me in\\nresearching this book. I therefore gladly accept Chris’s confession.\\nThe second came when the most important interview for this book not only materialised\\nbut provided me with one of the most uplifting moments of my journalistic career.\\nI had identified early in my preparation that the most important person I needed to talk to\\nwas Jelena Gencic, the woman who taught Novak to play tennis. In March 2013 I went to\\nBelgrade on a bit of a flyer – I had a trip planned for the following month but wanted to\\nmake sure I actually had some interviews arranged, so decided it would be best to make\\nan exploratory advance trip. It was on that exploratory trip that Gencic was not only\\navailable but gave me two and a half hours of her time in her favourite watering hole, the\\nCafé Ozon in the Dedinje suburb of Belgrade. The question about \\nDesert Island Discs\\n (see\\npage 41) came fairly early,\\nand when she listed ‘Mahler’s Adagio’, I interrupted her and said, ‘Do you mean the\\nAdagietto from Mahler’s Fifth Symphony?’ Her eyes lit up. ‘Ah, you know it,’ she said and\\nfrom then on the connection between us was a wonderful one. As I left the café, I felt\\nmoved to hug her, even though I’d known her for barely two hours.\\nThe following day I was mulling over what she’d told me and was beginning to see the\\nchapter ‘Nole and Jeca’ that appears in this book. It all seemed too good to be true. Gencic\\nhad reminded me of my own grandmother, a great story teller but something of a\\nMärchentante\\n, a German word for a teller of stories that often improve with the telling. So I\\nasked my contact who had introduced me to Gencic whether I could trust what Jelena had\\ntold me. She seemed puzzled at my question. I explained that it seemed almost like a fairy\\ntale – the cultured woman from the affluent Yugoslav intelligentsia finding she had a total\\nmeeting of minds with this boy from a moderately simple family, and taught him a lot more\\nthan just forehands and backhands – and I wanted to be sure it wasn’t all a massive tale\\ntold to impress the journalist from abroad. My contact, who knew Gencic fairly well,\\nassured me that she was not the kind of woman to embellish stories, at least not more than\\nin a very minor way, and she always stuck to what she believed was the truth.\\nWhen I went back to Belgrade the following month, Jelena and her sister welcomed me\\nto their home. I wish I had enjoyed the Turkish coffee they gave me – I confess I found it\\nutterly disgusting but I very much appreciated the hospitality. I admired her trophies, asked\\nher a few more questions and checked a few details from my interview a few weeks earlier.\\nAs I left, she promised to check anything else I wasn’t sure about if I’d just email it to her. I\\nnever saw her again.\\nJelena Gencic died on 1 June 2013. Unbeknown to me, she had been fighting breast\\ncancer for some time, but it wasn’t that that killed her. Most people close to her knew she\\nhad breast cancer and \\nshe had largely beaten it. But few knew that she also had liver\\ncancer, and that finished her. I saw her five weeks before she died. She was spending 7–\\n10 hours a day on the tennis court, not running around but doing lots of coaching. She\\nlooked like she could have planned her 90th birthday party but at 76 her life came to an\\nabrupt end.',\n",
       " 'I was told about her death by text message. I was at Roland Garros and the message\\ncame with the strict instruction that I was to say nothing to anyone close to Djokovic until\\nhe had gone on court for his third-round match against Grigor Dimitrov. That was wise\\nadvice, for when Djokovic came off court, he was given the news, burst into tears and\\npromptly cancelled all media obligations because he was so upset. After his fourth-round\\nwin, he was happy to talk about her and his 10-minute English press conference was\\nalmost exclusively about Gencic. I remember that Saturday night for the strange emotion of\\ngrieving for someone I’d met just twice and hardly knew but who I felt I knew very well. I\\nwas also the last journalist to do a formal interview with her, so was consumed by the\\nuncomfortable mix of relief and elation of having got her to talk before she left us, and\\nterrible sadness that she should die with so much vitality apparently still left in her.\\nAs such, in the months since her death I have mulled over whether I have become too\\nemotional in the section about her. And whether I have afforded her an importance in the\\nDjokovic story that goes beyond what she warrants. I don’t think I have. Djokovic himself\\ntalks about destiny, and while he’s likely to have made it to the top in tennis even without\\nGencic’s input, I remain convinced that he would not be the person he is today without her\\ninfluence and his route to the top would not have been as painless. After all, he does have\\na number of health issues that he has had to overcome through a lot of trial and error –\\nwould he have been open to the holistic approach of an Igor Cetojevic (see pages 174–6)\\nif he had \\nnot been exposed to Gencic’s open-mindedness at an early age? And would he,\\nwithout Gencic, have developed the sense of statesmanship that allows him to straddle the\\ntwo worlds of his fiercely patriotic Serbia and a global community that has grown to like\\nhim but still mistrusts the country he hails from? It would be wrong to overplay Gencic’s\\nrole in Djokovic’s tennis development – she never travelled with him and he did have four\\nyears in his early adulthood when he wasn’t even in contact with her – but I am convinced\\nshe deserves a chapter of her own.\\n \\nA classic question people ask when they see a biography is whether it is ‘authorised’ or\\nnot. I dislike the term ‘authorised’, as it implies something official, with the content\\ncontrolled by the subject. I have no desire to write a book about Novak Djokovic that is\\ncontrolled by him – he is intelligent enough to write his own book if he wishes, in which he\\ncan say what he likes (as he is highly likely to do at some stage). That will have validity as\\nhis take on his career with the inside story on certain events, but it will only be his side of\\nthe story. This book has many people’s input on his life and career (so far).\\nThis, therefore, is an \\nindependent\\n biography, both of Djokovic and of Serbia. It is my take\\non him and his country. People can disagree with what I say and some of it is opinion\\nrather than peer-reviewed research. In terms of his own approach to it, because he wants\\nto write his own book when he retires, he wasn’t keen for his closest family to talk to me –\\nsomething I have respected. Those who are part of his team are bound by a confidentiality\\nagreement but many people who are close to him have been willing to talk to me, for which\\nI sincerely thank them. And Djokovic himself has helped me by answering a number of\\nquestions I put to him about his role as a sporting statesman.\\nIt’s important to make this clear because Djokovic is a superstar. \\n‘Do you realise just\\nhow much the country stops when he plays?’ asked Guy De Launey, the BBC’s Belgrade\\ncorrespondent, when I met him to get his views for some of the chapters on Serbia. And\\nDjokovic’s friend Dusan Vemic says, ‘If Novak is playing some big matches during the\\nGrand Slam season, the streets are empty. Everyone is at home cheering for him.’ He has\\ntherefore attained the status of something approaching a secular saint in Serbia, much of it',\n",
       " 'deserved, but it is still important to look at him dispassionately. This is why I have been\\ncritical of him at certain points in this book – not out of malice but simply because he is a\\nhuman being made of flesh and blood, and in our celebrity-dominated era, it’s important to\\nbe able to see that even the people we most admire are packages of good and not-so-\\ngood attributes.\\n \\nA word about accents. A number of accents are used in central and eastern European\\northography, many of them reflecting the transfer of Slav names from the Cyrillic to the\\nRoman alphabet. I had to make a decision whether to use accents or not and, realistically,\\nit was all or nothing. My instinct as someone who has learned three languages beyond my\\nmother tongue was to put the accents in, but in the end, I opted not to. The main reason for\\nthis is that the name ‘Djokovic’ is a westernisation of how his name is written at home. The\\nRoman alphabet version is ‘Ðoković’, with the j added in typefaces where the line through\\nthe D is not available (like the way an e is added in German when the \\nUmlaut\\n is not\\navailable, so ‘Schüttler’ becomes ‘Schuettler’, ‘Görges’ becomes ‘Goerges’, etc.). Given\\nthat Novak is known across the English-speaking world as ‘Djokovic’, it would have gone\\nagainst the grain to call him ‘Ðjoković’ throughout this book and the logical extension was\\nto exclude all accents. I beg forgiveness from fellow-linguists who feel that judgement was\\nwrong.\\nAnd while we’re on the name, let me try and lay to rest the \\nindefatigable question of how\\nyou pronounce the first vowel in ‘Djokovic’. The Americans have pushed the line that it\\nshould be pronounced as in the word ‘joke’, while the rest of the world has tended to say\\n‘jock’. The idea of ‘joke’ comes from a belief that the best thing you can do is to copy the\\nway the person says his own name. Indeed, this continued even into the 2013 Australian\\nOpen when Jim Courier used a question in a post-match on-court interview to try and get\\nDjokovic to give him the definitive pronunciation of the troublesome vowel.\\nThe sentiment of asking the person concerned how he (or she) pronounces their name is\\na nice one but it misses a very simple relevant fact: how they pronounce other words with\\nthe same vowel. If you listen to the way Djokovic says words like ‘on’ and ‘over’, it’s clear\\nhis (and other Serbs’) pronunciation of his surname is the same vowel as ‘on’, not ‘over’.\\nThat means the pronunciation based on ‘jock’ is the correct one and ought to come as a\\nrelief to the entire English-speaking world, as the strictly accurate pronunciation is more\\nlike ‘or’ (so ‘Djorkovic’) than ‘jock’ or ‘joke’. Where the Americans can claim some\\njustification is that the vowel sound in ‘Novak’ is pretty much the same as in ‘Djokovic’, so\\nreally the English-speaking world should be saying ‘Novak’ as in ‘of’ and ‘Djokovic’ as in\\n‘jock’. But no doubt the debate will rage as long as he’s playing, so radio and television\\npronunciation units can continue to justify their existence.\\n \\nFinally, I couldn’t have produced this book without the help of lots of people. I list them\\nhere in alphabetical order with more thanks than I can convey and a fear that I have left\\none or two out: Edoardo Artaldi, Simon Cambers, Igor Cetojevic, Estelle Couderc, Michael\\nDavenport, Guy De Launey, Jelena Gencic, Mitzi Ingram-Evans, Goran Ivanisevic, Ana\\nIvanovic, Momir Jelovac, Cathy Jenkins, Jonathan Jobson, Ladislav Kis, Angela Lavinski,\\nDavid \\nLaw, Ivan Ljubicic, Stevan Lukic, Janice McKinlay, Neda Miletic, Helen McCarthy,\\nJoanna Mather, Peter Miles, Stuart Miller, Zoran Milosavljevic, Ana Mitric, Vladimir Novak,\\nBogdan Obradovic, Dejan Petrovic, Riccardo Piatti, Nikki Pilic, Monica Seles, Greg\\nSharko, Cedomir Soskic, Toplica Spasojevic, Vojin Velickovic, Gavin Versi, Nebojsa\\nViskovic and Jonathan Wilson.

       " 'CHAPTER ONE\\nAN ETHNIC MIX\\nT\\nhe philosopher and travel writer Hermann Keyserling once wrote, ‘I am not a Dane, not a\\nGerman, not a Swede, not a Russian nor an Estonian, so what am I? – a little of all these.’\\nThus, in an era where transport allows for inter-nation marriages as a matter of course, no\\none should be too surprised to find that Serbia’s leading global flag-carrier, Novak\\nDjokovic, should be a real ethnic mix. At least he was born in Serbia – unlike India’s\\nspiritual leader Mahatma Gandhi, who was born in South Africa, or America’s most\\npatriotic Davis Cup player John McEnroe, who was born in Germany. But from his ethnic\\nheritage you could argue he was half-Montenegrin and half-Croat.\\nDoes this matter? Hardly at all. As Djokovic’s close friend Ivan Ljubicic says, ‘You can\\nbe patriotic without being nationalistic.’ And Ljubicic should know – born in the Bosnian\\ntown of Banja Luka to a Bosnian Muslim mother and a Croatian Catholic father, he barely\\npassed through Croatia en route to the relative safety of Italy during the Yugoslav wars of\\nthe 1990s, yet became Croatia’s \\nnational hero when he steered the still-young republic to\\nthe Davis Cup title in 2005 with a record-breaking 11 straight wins in live matches. In the\\nBalkans there are thousands of people who are the products of inter-nation marriages. In\\nfact, having links to Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Croatia probably broadens\\nDjokovic’s Balkan fan base.\\nTracing the Djokovic family tree back, the records are sketchy but the first obvious\\nancestor is Djoko Damjanovic, who appears to have established the Djokovic surname\\naround 1730. The suffix ‘-vic’ means ‘son of’, like ‘-son’ in England, ‘Mc/Mac’ in Scotland,\\n‘’O’ in Ireland, etc. So Djoko Damjanovic’s children had the surname Djokovic, after which\\nthe same surname was passed through male descendants. Damjanovic set up home in\\nJasenovo Polje, a village whose name means ‘ash fields’ near the Montenegrin town of\\nNiksic. In 1928 the head of the family, Nedeljko Djokovic, moved east from Montenegro to\\na village called Vocnjak in Metohija, part of the province of Kosovo, which at that time was\\npart of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia. In 1951 Nedeljko’s son Vladimir, Novak’s\\ngrandfather, moved to Mitrovica, the main ethnic Serbian town in Kosovo. In 1961 his son\\nSrdjan was born and in 1964 he had a second son, Goran.\\nThere had been one Novak Djokovic in the family. He grew up in Jasenovo Polje before\\nemigrating to Chicago in 1905 but returned to fight for his country. Apparently, when filling\\nin his immigration form as his ship docked in the USA, under ‘Nationality (country of which\\ncitizen or subject)’ he wrote ‘Montenegro’ and under ‘Race of people’ ‘Montenegrin’.\\nMontenegro at that time was already recognised as a sovereign state, having come to a\\nform of independence in 1878 under the same settlement that saw Serbia become\\nindependent from the Ottoman Empire.\\nIn 1986 Srdjan married Dijana Zagar. She was born in Belgrade in January 1964, the\\ndaughter of two military personnel. Her father \\nZdenka was a high-ranking officer in the\\nYugoslav National Army and a pharmacist, who became purchasing manager for a military\\nhospital. Her mother Elizabete was a major in the army and a chief medical officer in the\\nmilitary hospital (Dijana’s sister is a pharmacist as well). They were originally from\\nVinkovici, a town in the eastern part of Croatia near the Serbian border, and they moved to\\nBelgrade before Dijana’s birth when Zdenka was transferred by the army to the military',\n",
       " 'hospital in what was then the Yugoslav capital. Not surprisingly, Djokovic has lots of\\nrelatives in and around Vinkovici.\\nVery little is known about either family. The few interviews that Srdjan gives are\\ngenerally about his son or Serbian tennis politics, while Dijana gives virtually no\\ninterviews. The Serbian tennis writer Vojin Velickovic says, ‘Because Srdjan is so volatile,\\nwe never asked him too much because we didn’t want to go too far, and I don’t need that\\nkind of information for my tennis reports.’ Some reports say Srdjan was at one stage a\\nfootballer on the books of Mitrovica’s main club FC Trepca, while the fact that he and\\nDijana gave skiing lessons leads to the assumption that they were gifted skiers. ‘Maybe\\nSrdjan was a football player,’ Velickovic says, ‘but no one remembers. If he did play, it\\nwould be at a very low level. We assume he was a good skier but that’s also a grey area.’\\nDijana’s family is known to have a fair bit of volleyball talent but she didn’t play much.\\nVelickovic adds, ‘A friend of hers told me she was a very gifted gymnast. Obviously Novak\\nis very flexible, so when I spoke to him once, I told him that I’d heard he’d inherited his\\ngenes from his mother, not his father, because he was so flexible. And he joked, “Yes, I’m\\na champion because of my mother, not my father.” But she never wanted to give an\\ninterview to the media, maybe because she doesn’t want to be in the spotlight.’\\nOne person who got some insight into the Djokovic family home was Djokovic’s first\\ncoach, Jelena Gencic. She got to know the \\nfamily when Novak was five, which was about\\nthe time his paternal grandmother died. She recalled, ‘Srdjan’s father Vladimir, known as\\nGrandfather Vlada, was a very good man. He was a man of great warmth who made you\\nfeel nice. His wife died the year I started working with Novak, so I didn’t know her but\\neveryone says she was an excellent woman, such a humanitarian, so unbelievable –\\nmaybe Novak has his humanity from her? It was a very patriarchal family. The grandfather\\nwas the patriarch. We couldn’t start eating until the patriarch had sat down and started to\\neat. And we couldn’t get up until he had given his approval. So Novak had a very good\\nfamily education. The family wasn’t primitive but only ever had just enough.’\\nOn 22 May 1987 Srdjan and Dijana celebrated the birth of their first son, Novak, in\\nBelgrade. It was just four days after Srdjan’s 26th birthday. At that stage they were\\nrestaurateurs in Belgrade. Two years later, with the political and economic situation in\\nYugoslavia starting to look very precarious, they and Srdjan’s brother Goran opened up a\\nsecond restaurant, a pizzeria which also sold pancakes, and a boutique in Kopaonik, a\\nmountain resort on the boundary where Kosovo started, about 50km (as the crow flies)\\nfrom Mitrovica. They didn’t spend all year there – only the peak skiing season in winter and\\nthe hiking season in summer. In winter they had the punishing regime of giving skiing\\nlessons by day and working in the restaurant at night. The rest of the time they lived in\\nBelgrade.\\nIn August 1991 Marko Djokovic was born, and a third son, Djordje, was born in July\\n1995. Once Novak began going to school, it meant that during the skiing and hiking\\nseasons he often had to stay in the Belgrade flat of the newly widowed Grandfather Vlada,\\nsometimes for several weeks at a stretch. He was later to seek refuge from the 1999 Nato\\nbombing of Belgrade in the basement store of that flat. When Vlada died in April 2012\\nduring the Monte Carlo Masters, the media remarked that Djokovic didn’t seem quite the\\nsame and in fact did very well to reach the final where he lost to Rafael Nadal. The death\\nof a grandparent affects everyone differently but this was no ordinary grandparent – Vlada\\nwas a parental substitute who was a massive figure in Djokovic’s life.\\nThis dual existence of the urban landscape of Belgrade and the rural, mountainous\\nlandscape of Kopaonik not only shaped Djokovic but gave him a heightened sense of his',\n",

Each\\nstone, mountain, city, village has some powerful story to it, that I am very proud of. That’s\\nwhy we Serbs have very strong sense of belongingness, because of our history.\\nEverybody has heard of Belgrade, but my country has so many beautiful cities and villages\\nthat people should come and see. So many legends they can hear about my people, kings\\nand queens… I honestly think that the soul of my country lies within villages in the south.\\nKosovo is a cradle of Serbian history. It has over 2,000 monasteries and churches that\\nsymbolise our culture and the beginnings of the Serbian Orthodox religion. Belgrade is a\\nmodern metropolis, it can give you everything, but the true Serbia is in the south. I\\nremember myself as a kid spending a lot of time on Kopaonik and admiring every time the\\nview of Serbia I had from this beautiful and powerful mountain.’\\nLike any boy of five, young Novak enjoyed kicking a football and was taught to ski from a\\nvery early age. There was no history of tennis in the family – Srjdan and Dijana could\\nprobably have told you very little about it when one day their elder son caught sight of\\ntennis on the television. It ignited a spark in him that led him, a few weeks later, to\\napproach the woman who would set him on the road to being the best in the world.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER TWO\\nWHO ARE THE SERBS?\\nT\\no all but the keenest historians or current-affairs aficionados, the term ‘Serbia’ probably\\ndoesn’t mean a great deal – in fact, to many, the first image the term conjures up is\\nprobably that of Novak Djokovic, even to those who don’t call themselves tennis fans.\\nSome who have vague recollections of their history lessons at school may remember that\\nSerbia had something to do with the outbreak of the First World War, and those watching\\nthe news in the 1990s will have heard the name Serbia on many occasions, often in\\nconnection with the word ‘atrocities’. But even those who were regular news followers in\\nthe 1960s, 1970s and 1980s can be forgiven for not knowing where or what Serbia was.\\nThe reason for this is that, while the Serbs have existed in the south-eastern corner of\\nEurope known as the Balkans since the sixth century, for most of that time they have not\\nbeen a country in their own right. In fact, Serbia on its own has only been a sovereign state\\nthree times: from 1166 to 1459, from 1878 to 1918 \\nand from 2006 to the present. The\\nSerbs, therefore, are by no means a new people but they are a new country, hence the\\nscope for a dominant world sportsman to become a statesman and standard-bearer for his\\ncountry. (Technically, the term ‘Serb’ denotes an ethnic Serb, while a ‘Serbian’ is a citizen\\nof Serbia, so the difference can be important.)\\nThe Serbs are one of the Slav peoples. Because the Slavs are the fourth biggest ethno-\\nlinguistic grouping in the world, it’s hard to give a precise definition of Slavs but they are an\\nIndo-European race who are generally divided into three groups: the eastern Slavs\\npopulating today’s Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, plus parts of central Asia and Siberia; the\\ncentral Slavs populating countries and areas such as Poland, the Czech Republic,\\nSlovakia and Silesia; and the southern Slavs, of which the Serbs are the biggest group,\\nalong with the Croats, Montenegrins, Bulgarians and Macedonians (but not Slovenes or\\nAlbanians). The southern Slavs are largely Christian, though with various differences. For\\nexample, the Serbs are largely Orthodox Christian, while the Croats are Roman Catholic.\\nFor much of the 14th century Serbia was the most powerful state in the Balkans, but it\\nwas defeated in the battle of Kosovo Field in 1389, marking the end of its pre-eminence.\\nAfter the battle of Smederovo in 1459, the independent kingdom of Serbia was subsumed\\ninto the Ottoman Empire, the Turkish empire ruled from the ancient city of Constantinople\\n(now Istanbul). The 1389 defeat in Kosovo became a scar on Serbian national\\nconsciousness, which lingered into the 20th century, as the province of Kosovo became of\\npsychological importance to Serbia, even though by the late 20th century it was populated\\nlargely by ethnic Albanians. It has some relevance to the Djokovic story: Djokovic’s father\\nand grandfather were from Kosovo, the ski resort of Kopaonik where Novak first learned to\\nplay tennis is right on the border between the undisputed \\nSerbian territory and Kosovo,\\nand Djokovic had to shelter from the 1999 Nato bombing raids on Belgrade that resulted\\nfrom the ethnic Serb-Albanian conflict in Kosovo.\\nUntil 1918 most of the southern Slav peoples were under the control of larger empires,\\ngenerally either the Ottoman Empire or the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But long before the\\nFirst World War those empires were decaying. The Ottomans’ heyday had been in the 16th\\nand 17th centuries; by 1850 the empire was becoming harder to hold together, while\\nAustria-Hungary was ruled by the Habsburg royal family of Vienna, who were increasingly',\n",
       " 'fighting domestic battles closer to home as nationalist fervour grew in states that are\\ntoday’s Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.\\nSome suggestions had been mooted in the middle of the 19th century that the southern\\nSlavs might join forces in a united country but the largest of them also had their eye on\\nbecoming nation states of their own. Serbia and Montenegro were the first of them to break\\nfree from Ottoman control, becoming countries in their own right in 1878 following the\\nRusso-Turkish war. Russia’s foreign policy at that time was geared towards trying to get\\naccess to the Mediterranean Sea and, to this end, it developed friendly relations with\\nSerbia, a fellow Slav nation. Out of that grew Serbia’s military and diplomatic alliance with\\nRussia, which played a part in the outbreak of the First World War. The traditional\\ninterpretation has been that, when a Serb radical, Gavrilo Princip, shot dead the heir to the\\nAustro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo in June 1914, it\\ntriggered the diplomatic tit-for-tat and mobilisation of forces that led to the outbreak of war\\nfive weeks later: Austria declared war on Serbia to avenge the killing, Russia was\\ncompelled to come to Serbia’s aid, Germany came to Austria’s aid and the whole thing\\nbecame the world’s first global conflict. Recently it has been suggested that this is too\\nsimple – that Germany was dead-set on going to war and was looking for an \\nexcuse to\\ndeclare war on Serbia. Whatever the ultimate motivation, by the summer of 1914 Europe\\nwas like a tinder-dry forest just waiting for a spark to set the whole continent alight, and the\\nSarajevo assassination was the spark that started what became known as ‘the Great War’.\\nWith the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires effectively crushed during the war,\\n1918 was the obvious time for new nations to emerge in south-eastern Europe. But the\\nlegacy of being ruled by a large empire, allied to fears that Italy might try to sweep up a lot\\nof territory along the Adriatic coast, led to the formation of a country made up initially of\\nseveral southern Slav peoples. It was called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\\nbut it also included Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia-Slavonia, a semi-\\nautonomous region of Hungary, and Dalmatia (Monica Seles, Yugoslavia’s most\\nsuccessful tennis player, was ethnically a Hungarian who came from Novi Sad in the\\nSerbian province of Vojvodina). The new kingdom was proclaimed in December 1918 and\\nruled by the Serbian royal family, initially under King Peter I. For many Serbs, the kingdom\\nwas a continuation of the Serbian sovereignty that had existed since 1878, and certainly it\\namounted to a form of self-determination compared with being under Turkish or Austrian\\nrule. But it’s perhaps easier for the Serbs to feel this way, as they were the dominant nation\\nin the new kingdom, whereas Croats, Slovenes and other nations find it harder to see this\\nas full independence, at least compared to the independence and sovereignty they have\\nenjoyed since the early 1990s.\\nReligiously, the Serbs are Orthodox Christian while the Croats are Roman Catholic, but\\nthe Serb language is very close to Croatian (almost as close as British English and\\nAmerican English are to each other), and Macedonian and Slovenian are also related to\\nSerbian and Croatian. Given that there had been lots of migration and intermarriage\\namong the southern Slav peoples, the new kingdom \\nought to have worked. After all, in\\n1871 22 German-speaking kingdoms, principalities and duchies had come together to form\\na new country called Germany, and while it had led itself – and the world – into a\\ndisastrous war, it had worked as a country and was still intact. The ethnic, linguistic and\\ncultural differences between the Serbs and Croats are not as pronounced as those\\nbetween the Prussians and Bavarians, so the new southern Slav country had every\\nchance of succeeding.\\nOr so went the theory.

The first result was a\\nstrengthening of state powers in 1929, making the kingdom effectively a dictatorship. The\\noutward sign of that was a change of name – as the kingdom was an alliance of southern\\nSlav peoples, it adopted the name Yugoslavia, from the Slav words ‘jugo’ (of the south)\\nand ‘slavija’ (Slavs).\\nYugoslavia survived the assassination of its tennis-loving king, Alexander I, in 1934 – he\\nwas shot dead by a Macedonian working with Croatian separatists – but it didn’t survive\\nthe outbreak of the Second World War. In 1941 it was taken over by the Axis powers\\n(Germany and Italy), who set up a particularly nasty Croatian-led fascist government, the\\nUstase. The Ustase set about liquidating Jews and gipsies, and relegating Serbs to\\nsomewhere well below the status of second-class citizens.\\nIt was, in effect, ethnic cleansing, a term that only came into widespread use in the\\n1990s. When people talk about the Yugoslav civil war, they generally refer to the battles of\\nthe 1990s that led to the break-up of Yugoslavia and the establishment of new sovereign\\nstates, but the period 1941–45 saw an equally brutal civil war which left unresolved many\\nof the resentments that flared up again in the 1990s. The Ustase’s brutality (even some\\nmembers of the Nazi high \\ncommand in Berlin felt their acolytes in Zagreb were going too\\nfar) led to resistance from the Cetniks, a pro-monarchist Serbian movement, and from the\\nPartisans, a communist movement led by a former Russian revolutionary, Josip Broz Tito.\\nSo while the Second World War raged to the north, the Ustase, Cetniks and Partisans\\nfought out the bloody civil war for the remains of Yugoslavia.\\nIn short, Tito and his Partisans won that civil war and set up a new Yugoslav republic\\ntaking in six federated states: Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro\\nand Macedonia. The Yugoslav capital was the Serbian capital, Belgrade. Tito’s pitch was\\na communist one (in the sense of a state-controlled economy working in the interests of the\\nworking class), with the slogan ‘brotherhood and unity’. He also had immense personal\\ncharisma, plus a transnational profile based on having a Croatian father, a Slovenian\\nmother, and operating from Serbia’s principal city. Having gained material support from the\\nAllied powers (Great Britain, the USA and the USSR), he was seen by many of his\\ncompatriots as the man who had liberated Yugoslavia, so he was a popular leader after\\n1945.\\nTito ruled Yugoslavia for the next 35 years. Originally a supporter of Stalin’s communist\\nstate in Russia, he broke from Moscow in 1948, pursuing his own form of communism\\nindependently of the USSR’s influence. During the Cold War, Tito and Yugoslavia gained\\na respected global position as one of the leading players in the Non-Aligned Movement, a\\nloose association of largish countries who refused to ally themselves with either the USA\\nor the USSR. He also oversaw an economic boom in the 1950s and 1960s, and allowed\\nYugoslav citizens to travel abroad for work and pleasure, something other countries in the\\nSoviet bloc did not permit.\\nThe West loved Yugoslavia. As western nations battled with the threat posed by the\\nSoviet Empire run from Moscow, they enjoyed \\nhaving a communist state in eastern Europe\\nthat was not under Moscow’s thumb. But as Tito aged, so the fears grew about whether it\\nwas only he who could hold together the six disparate states, and many asked what would\\nhappen when he died. Some were unworried, saying the governing structure of Yugoslavia\\nwould survive the demise of one man, or another leader would emerge, while others feared\\nthe worst. Both were proved right, after a fashion.\\nTito died in 1980 and for a while Yugoslavia carried on as normal. But the nationalist',\n",
       " 'passions that Tito had held under control (at times by raw oppression – his regime has\\nbeen described by some as ‘an iron fist in a velvet glove’) gained in confidence and, as the\\nconcept of communism fell into disrepute across eastern Europe in the late 1980s, the\\nnationalism of the six Yugoslav states grew and grew.\\nThose who had hoped a dominant figure might emerge to assume Tito’s role thought\\nthey might have found their man when Slobodan Milosevic became the president of\\nSerbia. He was certainly a very charismatic and ambitious leader, who wanted to preside\\nover the whole of Yugoslavia. But Tito was a war hero who had the mixed Croat-Slovene\\nparentage and was at home in Belgrade, whereas Milosevic was Serb through and\\nthrough. And while his oratory might have roused the Serbs, it was anathema to the other\\npeoples of Yugoslavia, so he was never going to become a leader in the Tito mould.\\nOnce he realised that Serbia was never going to take over the whole of Yugoslavia,\\nMilosevic embarked on a policy that effectively laid the foundations for the wars that broke\\nup the federation. He was relatively happy for peoples that formed different nations to\\nsecede from Yugoslavia, as long as they didn’t take any predominantly Serb areas with\\nthem. So, for example, he was content for Slovenia to go, as there were very few Serbs\\nthere, and he was also willing for Croatia to have independence, as long as it \\ndidn’t take\\nthe mainly Serb region of Krajina with it. Yet Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, Montengrins,\\nMacedonians, Albanians and others had migrated and intermarried within the southern\\nSlav states for decades (including Novak Djokovic’s Kosovan Serb/ Montenegrin father\\nand Croatian mother), so such a clean division into ethnically defined states was always\\ngoing to create massive problems.\\nWhen Milosevic met with the emerging Croatian leader Franjo Tudjman, a veteran of the\\nbloody civil war of 1941–45, to agree the ethnic divide of Bosnia in March 1990, so\\nBosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats could be part of the emerging Serbia and Croatia, they\\nwere effectively setting out the conditions for war. That war broke out the following year\\nwith appalling consequences.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER THREE\\nNOLE AND JECA\\nT\\nhere used to be a saying: Behind every successful man is a powerful woman. The\\ndictum has somewhat fallen victim to changing social circumstances – marriage break-up,\\nsame-sex relationships, and support teams rather than old-fashioned family structures. But\\nit can still prove to be true. There is certainly a woman behind Novak Djokovic’s success\\nbut not quite in the way one would expect. That woman is Jelena Gencic.\\nSome day an imaginative film-maker might like to make a film about the relationship\\nbetween Djokovic and Gencic. It might be called ‘Nole and Jeca’ after the names the two\\nused to call each other (‘Nole’ is a classic nickname for ‘Novak’, pronounced ‘No-lay’;\\n‘Jeca’, pronounced ‘Yet-sa’, is a common short form for Jelena among a certain age\\ngroup). It would be a quiet, understated film, in which the eyes of the boy playing Novak\\nwould be crucially important and the use of classical music would play a central part,\\nperhaps with the Adagietto from Mahler’s fifth symphony reprising \\nthe haunting role it\\nplayed in Luchino Visconti’s 1971 epic \\nDeath in Venice\\n. The scope is certainly there\\nbecause the relationship between the two is a remarkable one, partly because it defies all\\nconventional attempts to categorise it. And while Djokovic would probably have become a\\ngreat tennis player without Gencic, it’s likely he wouldn’t have become the person he is\\nwithout her.\\nAs well as Djokovic, Gencic worked with Monica Seles and played a minor but\\nsignificant part in the formative years of Goran Ivanisevic. For that, she is entitled to be\\nregarded as one of the leading tennis coaches of her era. She not only rejected that notion,\\nshe didn’t even like calling herself a tennis coach. In an era where it’s virtually impossible\\nto do anything professionally unless you have a formal qualification, she coached until a\\nweek before her death having never taken a test or exam that led to a tennis-coaching\\nqualification. Her university degree was in art history, she had a secondary qualification in\\npsychology, and her career was as a television producer, editor and director.\\nJelena Gencic was born in October 1936 to a Serb father and Austrian mother. The\\nfamily was moderately prominent in Yugoslavia. Her grandfather Lazar Gencic studied\\nmedicine in Vienna and went on to become surgeon general and set up a military hospital.\\nHe was a great believer in a healthy mind residing in a healthy body and insisted on\\noutdoor exercise for his children and grandchildren every day, whatever the weather. Her\\ngreat-uncle was interior minister in the first Yugoslav government after the First World War.\\nHer father Jovan wanted to be a pianist – it didn’t work out but he became a respected\\nlawyer. And she had an aunt, Ana Marinkovic, who was a prominent artist (1882–1973). As\\na child she followed her father’s example and learned the piano to a high level, but her\\npassions were two sports: tennis and handball. She played for the Yugoslav national\\nhandball team and won 32 national tennis titles.\\nAt that time, tennis was an amateur sport and Yugoslavia was a country with a\\ncollectivist (state-controlled) economy. Gencic had everything paid for but was expected to\\ngive something back, in the form of helping youngsters. She therefore began informal\\ncoaching well before her tournament-playing days ended in 1976.\\nThe restrictions of Tito’s Yugoslavia in the 1950s and 1960s meant that only the best two\\nplayers were allowed to travel abroad. There were no entourages the way there are today,',\n",
       " 'and Gencic would frequently have to play a match at Wimbledon or Forest Hills (the former\\nhome of the US Open) the day after an arduous journey. It was one early-round defeat that\\nstarted her on the road to helping the likes of Seles and Djokovic. ‘Because I knew that\\nwhen I stopped playing tournaments I wanted to help young people play tennis,’ she said,\\n‘especially those who didn’t have a coach, and I knew I wanted to explain and show them\\nhow to play, I used a defeat in the second round at Forest Hills to go out and buy some\\nbooks. America has very good articles and books about tennis, so I bought nothing but\\ntennis books, that’s the only thing I bought, in particular Vic Braden, and I built up my\\nlibrary.’\\nBy the time tennis went ‘open’ (professional) in 1968, Gencic was 31 and, realistically,\\npast the age when she could earn her living as a player. Besides, by then her career in\\ntelevision was well in train. But inevitably she was asked to get involved in the\\nadministration of tennis. As she had played for Partizan Belgrade (the leading clubs in\\nmany European cities are multi-sports clubs, so Belgrade’s teams Partizan and Red Star\\nare widely known as football teams but have all sorts of other sporting teams too, including\\ntennis), the board of the tennis club asked her to join them with a view to preparing her to\\nbe president of the club and possibly the Yugoslav Tennis Association. So she worked her\\nway up the lay administrator ladder, all the time doing her day job in television. It was a\\ndual existence she clearly revelled in.\\nThere was a potential overlap between her two worlds but it never actually happened –\\nshe never worked in sport in her television career. She worked almost exclusively on\\ncultural programmes, mainly history of art in Serbia and the world, but she also made\\nprogrammes on classical music and theatre. Every five years she changed her emphasis\\nas she had a lot of interests. But she never worked in sport because Yugoslav television\\ngrouped political reporting and sport together; sport and politics came under one heading,\\nwhile culture and the arts were separate.\\nThings began to change in the early 1980s when Gencic, by then in her forties, saw a\\nlittle girl who looked smaller than her eight years. She was an ethnic Hungarian from Novi\\nSad, a city in the north of Serbia whose population was made up of around 20 per cent\\nethnic Hungarians. Her name was Monica Seles. ‘She was so little, so tiny,’ Gencic\\nrecalled, ‘but I saw something in her eyes. I watch the eyes with every child. If a little boy or\\nlittle girl comes to me, and if they have the patience to look at me for more than 10 or 15\\nseconds without their eyes wandering, I say, “This boy or girl has a good concentration,\\nmotivation and patience – maybe this boy or girl would be very good at practising.” If you\\ntry to speak to a six-or seven-year-old, they’re looking all around. I was watching Monica.\\nShe was eight and her father Karolij asked me to come to Novi Sad. I ended up working\\nwith her for more than three years and doing a lot of travelling with her.’\\nMany accounts say Gencic coached Seles. She was never her formal coach – she was\\neffectively captain of the Yugoslav Tennis Association’s juniors and therefore travelled\\nwith the country’s best youngsters. Seles was not the only one of whom great things were\\nexpected: there was another gifted Yugoslav tennis player just a year and a half older than\\nSeles, a Croatian boy called Goran Ivanisevic. Gencic accompanied Seles and Ivanisevic\\nto tournaments like Bruehl in Germany (Steffi Graf’s home town) and Blois in France, and\\nGencic gave Seles and Ivanisevic coaching tips. But the only formal coaches Seles ever\\nhad were her father Karolij and her brother Zoltan, in the sense that they spent hours on\\ncourt with her (she doesn’t even count Nick Bollettieri as her coach, even though she\\nacknowledges the immense value of the assistance he gave her).\\nThe shift in Gencic would probably have happened anyway – with her sporting,',\n",
       " 'emotional and educational make-up, it’s hard to see her not having become a tennis coach\\nin some way. But what seeing Seles did for her was to put her various skills together and\\ngoad her into helping young tennis players formally. One day, when she was off work sick,\\nshe said to herself, ‘Jelena, some day you will stop working on television. We don’t have a\\ncoach, you’ve been a tennis teacher at university, you’ve got a second degree in\\npsychology – why don’t you become a coach? It’s easy to teach everyone forehands,\\nbackhands and smashes but not how to win matches, how to be mentally strong. How do\\nyou recognise a future champion? I could learn something myself too.’ It was more than\\njust learning. Gencic was one of seven children (four girls, three boys) but never had\\nchildren of her own. Working with Seles was the start of her own extended family, the start\\nof a process that saw her work with a number of talented youngsters.\\nSeles speaks very highly of Gencic:\\nI have so much respect for her – not just [because of] what she’s done in tennis but\\nwhat she’s done for women and girls in Serbia. Women were not put on the same rank\\nas men, they didn’t have the same opportunities – my father was always fighting for us\\nto have good facilities to practise, I started by playing in a parking lot and it was one of\\nthe reasons we decided to leave when I was 11 – we often just couldn’t get a court.\\nJelena was a pioneer in women’s sports, and Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic\\nprobably owe more to her than they realise. I never saw her after I was 11 years old\\nbut I remember her very fondly. She was a very positive influence, always smiling.\\nShe was a gentle soul who dedicated her life to tennis in a country where tennis and\\nwomen had no real place in the sports culture.\\nThe ‘gentle soul’ found herself tested with the young Ivanisevic, who even at that stage\\nwas known as a wild child. ‘When we were alone, I never had a problem with him,’ she\\nsaid. ‘Goran, Monica and me – we travelled everywhere together and everyone asked me\\nhow I handled Ivanisevic. And I replied, “He’s an excellent boy.” I never told him any ugly\\nwords, I’m always positive. Everyone had a problem with him except me. Monica helped\\nme handle Goran too – they were very close. They were like a son and daughter of mine.’\\nThe general gist of that comment may be true, but lest anyone think it was all plain\\nsailing, it wasn’t. Gencic was with Seles and Ivanisevic for the European under-14\\nchampionships in Heidelberg – the 12-year-old Seles dutifully won (she was only four\\nyears away from winning the French Open) but Ivanisevic was disqualified in the semi-\\nfinals, having behaved badly and broken at least one racket. ‘His nerves were so bad,’\\nGencic admitted, ‘it was very ugly to see.’ On another occasion, Gencic, Seles and\\nIvanisevic shared a room together at the prestigious Orange Bowl tournament, a situation\\nripe for tensions to rise inside the head of the wild child. One afternoon, while Gencic and\\nSeles were having a nap, Ivanisevic ripped the head off Seles’ doll. ‘Jelena punished me,’\\nrecalls Ivanisevic. ‘She said, “Don’t do that again,” and I had to run laps, all because I took\\nthe head off the doll.’ Asked why he felt the need to decapitate a doll, Ivaniseivc replies,\\n‘Because it was an ugly doll and it was getting on my nerves. When you’re 12, you do\\nthese stupid things.’ Seles has no recollection of this incident.\\n*\\nIn 1992 the president of Genex, the state tourism operator in Yugoslavia, asked Gencic if\\nshe would be the director of a tennis camp it wanted to run at its complex in Kopaonik.\\nKopaonik is a ski and walking resort in the mountains on the Serbian-Kosovo border. It',\n",
       " 'does well during the winter months but, despite its setting in picturesque countryside, it\\nstruggles a little in the summer months. So running summer-holiday tennis courses on the\\nhandful of hard courts it had built opposite a small shopping precinct seemed a good idea.\\nGencic was interested but had the problem that the summer camp was nine weeks. She\\nhadn’t taken any holiday but even to use up her entire holiday allowance wouldn’t have\\ncovered the nine weeks. But the board of Yugoslav TV decided to give her an extra three\\nweeks, so she was able to say yes. There was no question of a fee – Gencic didn’t want\\none and the camp was effectively run by the state, so while she didn’t get any payment,\\nshe did get all the equipment she wanted and enough coaches for one per court. That\\nallowed her to work out her programme, tell the coaches what she wanted and keep a\\nwatchful brief, monitoring all the courts like a foreman. Because Jelena Gencic was a\\nname that meant something to the parents of athletic youngsters, the camp proved very\\npopular.\\nAfter about an hour on the first morning, Gencic became aware of a small boy who\\nwasn’t part of the group but who had pressed himself against the fence behind one of the\\ncourts and was watching the action intently. At first she ignored him but after a while, with\\nthe boy still there, she remarked to one of the coaches that they had a very keen spectator.\\nShe then moved to another court and observed that the boy moved court too so he could\\nsee what Gencic was monitoring. He stayed there until the end of the session.\\nAs the camp broke for lunch, Gencic walked up to the boy and said, ‘Hello, I saw you\\nwatching us. Do you know which sport this is?’\\nThe boy replied, ‘Yes, this is tennis. I tried to play one month ago in Belgrade.’\\n‘How old are you?’ she asked.\\n‘Five.’\\n‘OK, would you like to play with us?’ asked Gencic.\\n‘I’ve been waiting for you to ask me to join you,’ he said.\\nGencic took a step back at this boldness by the tiny boy. ‘All right,’ she said, ‘you can\\njoin us this afternoon. What’s your name?’\\n‘Novak. Novak Djokovic.’\\n‘How long are you staying here?’\\n‘I’m here all summer.’\\n‘You live here or what?’\\n‘My mother and father work here; they have a pizzeria just across from the tennis court.’\\n‘Can you come at two o’clock? We’re having lunch now for two hours and at two we will\\ncontinue working. Do you have a racket?’\\n‘Yes, I do.’\\n‘Do you have shoes and everything?’\\n‘Yes, I do.’\\n‘All right, see you at two.’\\nBefore leaving for her lunch, Gencic called over her coaches and told them, ‘Please\\nwatch this boy. In particular, watch his eyes. He came alone, without parents, without\\nanyone – that’s very interesting.’\\nGencic’s apartment in Kopaonik was also close to the courts, in a high-rise building, so\\nshe could see the courts from her window. At 1.30pm she looked down and saw the boy\\nwaiting with his kit bag. So she made sure she was there before 2pm. ‘I’m sorry,’ she lied\\nto him, ‘I’ve forgotten your name.’\\n‘My name is Novak,’ he said. ‘You should not forget my name.’\\n‘I’m sorry, son, I’ll never forget your name again.’',\n",
       " 'She looked at his kit bag and said, ‘OK, come in, let’s talk about tennis. What do you\\nhave in your bag?’\\n‘Everything I need,’ the boy replied, showing her one racket, one bottle of water, two\\nsweatbands, a towel, a banana and three clean T-shirts.\\n‘How do you know what you need?’\\n‘I’ve seen it on TV.’\\n‘Who have you seen on TV?’\\n‘Sampras, Agassi, Edberg.’ It was the second week of Wimbledon, so there was a lot of\\ntennis on television at that time.\\n‘Who packed your bag?’ Gencic asked. ‘Your mother?’\\nThe boy frowned with anger. ‘I packed it! I’m playing tennis here, not my mother.’\\n‘Oh, Novak, that’s the second mistake I’ve made – please forgive me.’\\nOnly in December 2012, more than 20 years later, did Djokovic admit to Gencic that he’d\\nlied and his mother had indeed packed the bag, not him, although he had told her what she\\nneeded to pack from his television research. But somehow it doesn’t seem to matter – he\\nwas making a statement and Gencic got the message. ‘He was five years old and so\\nstrong,’ she said. ‘He was convinced I should not forget his name – I hadn’t forgotten, I was\\ntesting him, I’ve always tested him – and his ability to keep his eyes focused on me when\\nwe were talking made me think right away that this was a very unusual boy.’\\n \\nGencic insisted that she saw enough in that first afternoon to know that she had a potential\\nworld-beater on her hands. At the time, Monica Seles was world No. 1 in women’s tennis\\nand here was a boy who she said she felt could be the same in men’s tennis.\\nI tested him the way I test all my beginners, and he could do everything. At first I\\nshowed him how to hit strokes, but I soon realised that he had great motor skills,\\nmassive concentration, an ability to listen and watch. I called other coaches over and\\nsaid, ‘Watch this boy.’ Within a few minutes I offered to hit with him – he was so happy.\\nI had three or four coaches I’d been working with for about 20 years and I called one of\\nthem over and said, ‘I don’t want to say this but I’ll do it anyway – I predict that Novak\\nwon’t be in that group for long, he’ll be in the older group.’ I didn’t want to say he was\\nexcellent because he had to show that he is. I didn’t want to put pressure on him – he\\nhad to fight for it mentally.\\nAt the end of the day, Gencic asked the boy to introduce her to his parents. It wasn’t a long\\ntrip as the pizzeria was just across the road. And so ensued the conversation that was to\\nset Djokovic on the road to being the world’s best tennis player. Gencic explained:\\nHe was standing behind his mother with his head nestling into her side. I told his\\nparents what I’d seen in Novak and said, ‘You have a golden child. In the eight years\\nsince I stopped working with Monica Seles, I’ve never found as great a talent as your\\nchild. By the time he’s 17, he’ll be in the top five in the world.’ They were shocked.\\nThey looked at each other and looked at me. They didn’t know who I was, they only\\nknew that I was a coach at this camp. Suddenly it became clear how much emotion\\nthere was between Novak and me. When I said he’d be in the top five when he’s 17,\\nslowly, one step after another, Novak came up to me and put his head in my back. I\\nknew that our emotions were on the same wavelength.\\nSuch was Gencic’s recollection of the events of that late June day in 1992. Is it really true?',\n",
       " 'It’s a great tale but has the story perhaps improved with the telling? Possibly it has – after\\nall, Gencic was a consummate film-maker who knew how to bring artistic and \\ncultural\\nstories to life through her television work, so it’s possible a few details have been\\nembellished. But Djokovic himself has corroborated a lot of it in interviews, and others who\\nwere around at the time say it all stacks up.\\nA central feature of Gencic is that she was interested only in tennis and personal\\ndevelopment. She was not into money – she received countless offers to run private tennis\\ncamps but always turned them down. She was a woman of left-of-centre political views\\nand was clearly at home in a state-controlled economy where, if a service was offered, it\\nwas offered to everyone regardless of income or other means. She said, ‘I was a tennis\\nplayer, so I didn’t want to receive anything, I wanted only to help.’ She also had a\\ndeferential attitude to those she coached: ‘I never say I’m the best, I only try to get better\\nand help the children get better. The best is the child who is No. 1.’ In the course of her\\ninterviews for this book, she was given plenty of opportunities to claim clairvoyant skills for\\nother aspects of Djokovic’s progression but declined, often with a firm ‘no’. So even if the\\nstory has improved with the telling, it is likely to be a true story at heart.\\nHowever true it is, the sequence of events was weird and rushed enough for Dijana and\\nSrdjan Djokovic to have been forgiven for being a tad mistrustful when this fifty-something\\ncoach walked into their restaurant with their first-born and said he could be a world-beater\\nby 17. Gencic had clearly got the bit between her teeth and was purring enthusiastically\\nabout little Novak. She even claimed to have said to them, ‘This boy is mine, I must make\\nhim the best in the world,’ which sounds almost dangerous. Shortly afterwards, she said,\\nshe came to the conclusion that she needed to give up everything except her TV job –\\nwhich she needed to earn her living – to make sure Djokovic had the start he needed.\\nAt first the Djokovics didn’t say a word. Then they went away and tried to find out who\\nthis strange woman was and whether she \\nwas as crazy as she seemed. Everyone who\\nknew her told them she had discovered and worked with Monica Seles, which at the time\\nwas about the best reference she could have had. So they let Gencic work with their boy.\\nShe did, however, bring them somewhat down to earth the following day. She told them,\\n‘If you want me to work with Novak, I have only one condition – I will do my best for his\\ntennis but don’t ask me about money – that’s your problem not mine.’ Gencic knew that\\nwithin a couple of years they would need much more money for equipment, tournaments,\\ntravel, etc. Initially, it all came free – Gencic didn’t charge anything; she used her position\\nas president of Partizan Belgrade, one of only two state-funded tennis clubs in the country,\\nto get him rackets, balls and everything else he needed. But to make it in the fiercely\\ncompetitive world of professional tennis, he would need to find some money before long.\\nGencic and Djokovic started to work on day two of the summer camp. Gencic worked out\\na programme for him – one that lasted for five years. It needed to take account of the fact\\nthat he went to school in Belgrade but spent the summer months and part of the winter in\\nKopaonik when there was money to be made from the pizzeria and the boutique. He only\\nhad three weeks’ Christmas holiday but Gencic went to his head teacher and asked for\\none week more so she could do more work with him.\\nGencic’s insistence that she would look after the tennis but the family had to find the\\nmoney shielded the young boy from the family’s and country’s growing financial\\nchallenges, which were becoming more acute anyway – the Serbo-Croat war was raging\\nand an embryonic capitalist system was replacing the collectivist economy that had been\\nYugoslavia’s reality since 1945. The programme she prepared for him was not just a\\ncoaching plan but also a tournament plan for years one to five, including how much it was',\n",
       " 'likely to cost year by year and thus how much money the family \\nhad to be prepared to find.\\n‘This is the terrible part of the Djokovic family’s life,’ she said. ‘I knew they didn’t have\\nanything but neither did I. So I said they had to go to find some sponsors. They did find the\\nmoney but with some terrible conditions. Srjdan has said publicly that he got loans with\\nhigh interest rates, and when the day came to pay the money back and he hadn’t got any,\\nhe sometimes found a knife at his throat. The only way out was to take out a second loan to\\npay off the first loan, normally at very high rates.’\\nThese days, while Djokovic enjoys a very high standing among his compatriots, the\\nsame cannot be said for the rest of his family. His father and uncle have made enemies,\\nboth in broad society and specifically in tennis. In early 2011 a coup led by the Djokovic\\nfamily resulted in the president of the Serbian Tennis Federation, Slobodan Zivojinovic,\\nbeing ousted shortly after Serbia had won the 2010 Davis Cup and replaced by Vuk\\nJeremic, the president of the United Nations General Assembly and an ally of Srdjan\\nDjokovic. But Gencic said the wider context has to be understood:\\nPeople who criticise his parents don’t know or don’t want to know the full story of the\\nDjokovic family from the beginning. They see only money now; they think he [Srdjan]\\nis arrogant. The family were very friendly until they needed money for Novak. That\\nwas terrible. They knew that Novak would be the best, but how do you find money?\\nThey went out every day looking for money. Srdjan did get very angry but then he\\nknocked on every door, including the government’s, asking for help – he constantly\\ncame up against ‘Who is this boy?’, ‘We don’t have money for this little boy.’ Now they\\nlike to say, ‘We made him.’ I’m very happy for Srdjan to claim the credit for it because\\nwhat he did allowed Novak to go to tournaments. The Djokovic family has had a\\nterrible life until now. These days they have the money but I’m not interested how\\nthey’re living. I’m only interested in how Novak and [his younger brothers] Marko and\\nDjordje are doing.\\nThe work developing Novak Djokovic into a world-class tennis player progressed slowly\\nbut surely. He learned quickly but was a small boy, so Gencic sometimes had to wait for\\nhis body to catch up before she could move forward.\\nHaving grown up in the pre-Connors and pre-Evert era, Gencic’s natural inclination was\\nto teach the one-handed backhand. So for the first year or so of his tennis career, Djokovic\\nhit his backhand one-handed. Then one day, when he was about six and a half, he walked\\nup to Gencic and asked very politely, ‘Please, Jeca, can I try to play the backhand with two\\nhands?’ Gencic replied, ‘Of course, why not, but first of all I must explain to you how you\\nmust hold the racket for a two-handed backhand because you have three options: a left-\\nhanded forehand, a one-handed backhand with the second hand, or a genuinely two-\\nhanded shot. Try all three and after a week you will tell me which one is the best for you,\\nand whether you want to play with two hands or one hand.’ Exactly a week later, Djokovic\\ncame up to her unprompted, saying, ‘A week has passed and I’d like to explain to you – I’d\\nlike to play the backhand with two hands.’ She told him that was OK, as long as he stuck to\\na one-handed backhand slice and worked on it as a tool to get him to the net. He said he\\nfelt his backhands were much stronger with two hands than with one, so she said, ‘OK,\\nwe’ll go to work on that.’ They then worked very slowly without any pressure from Gencic,\\nbut she found him so intelligent and able to learn that he picked up the two-handed\\nbackhand very quickly.\\nOne of Djokovic’s principal attributes is his footwork, and he was complimented on that\\nfrom the beginning. Gencic said she recognised from day one that he was a good skier,',\n",
       " 'something she could also claim for herself, so essentially she taught him to adapt the basic\\nflexibility \\nin the ankles and legs that are core features for the skier to his tennis game. That\\neven allowed him to slide on hard courts, something that’s a common feature today but\\nwas very rare then.\\nAnother feature of Gencic’s coaching was that she tried to link it with the heroes her kids\\nwere seeing on television. She asked Djokovic what appealed to him when he saw the\\nlikes of Pete Sampras, Stefan Edberg and Andre Agassi playing in the biggest tennis\\narenas. On one occasion Djokovic said he wanted to play Sampras’s running down-the-\\nline forehand, so Gencic said she’d teach him. He wanted to serve and volley like Edberg,\\nso she taught him that (and was a little aggrieved that he doesn’t do that much of it as a\\nprofessional). And when he said he wanted to hit Agassi’s forehand, Gencic told him to\\nwatch where Agassi was standing during rallies. ‘Agassi stands inside the baseline,’ she\\nsaid, ‘so I taught him to stay on or inside the baseline. This was important because he was\\nvery little and didn’t have much power, so he had to take the ball early and go forward, with\\na very fast follow-through. He looked at Agassi, and started to play that way. That was\\ngood, because he didn’t have much power so he had to finish points much sooner than\\nyou think. I told him not to get involved in long rallies – when you get a shorter ball, go for\\nit.’\\nDjokovic also had very good volleys but was reluctant to make great use of them. He\\nonce told her, ‘Jeca, you want me to play volleys, but when I go to the net I feel like I’m in a\\nbattlefield facing a thousand bombs.’\\nAnother observation Gencic made about the young Novak was that he never once said\\nhe was tired. In fact, he was more likely to ask to stay another hour at the end of the\\nprogrammed practice period. ‘They were all playing four hours in the morning,’ she said of\\nher camps in Kopaonik, ‘then two hours off and then two hours more in the afternoon – so\\nsix hours including two hours of fitness work. We did it every day except when it was\\nraining.’\\nAnd he never tired mentally. Whenever they finished a practice session, Gencic knew\\nthe boy would ask her something about what they were doing. At one stage she said to\\nhim, ‘Novak, I have two university degrees – I think I now have a third degree because of\\nall your questions I’ve answered!’\\nGencic even claimed she had done her best to make him taller. ‘He was very late in\\ngrowing,’ she observed.\\nI read physiology books and asked people which exercises they could do to make a\\nboy taller. And I found nine exercises every day, three times a day, and you will be\\ntaller than you would have been. They’re very easy but you must really work at them; if\\nyou don’t work, you don’t get anywhere. I worked on fitness but only on the tennis\\ncourt, only on flexibility and agility, speed off the mark. I never worked on power with\\nhim, and no long-distance running. When you’re through puberty, you can start to work\\non power and your musculature will be long, which gives them flexibility and you can\\nthen work on the strength. But I wasn’t coaching him by then.\\nAs the months went by, word spread that this was a boy worth watching. Part of that word\\nwas spread by the boy himself. At seven he was invited on to a national television\\nprogramme where children interview children – appearing with the peak of his cap turned\\nto the back, he turned in a very cocksure performance that included the prediction that he\\nwould be No. 1 in the world. The clip is still available on the Internet, and even if you don’t\\nunderstand Serbian you can see the confidence shining through – but it’s the seven-year-',\n",
       " 'old’s confidence without arrogance; he was just answering a question as honestly as he\\ncould. ‘When I was seven or eight, I said I was going to be world No. 1,’ Djokovic told the\\nAmerican television station CBS in 2012, ‘and most of the \\npeople laughed at me. Those\\nwere very critical times for our country, so it seemed like I had a one per cent chance to do\\nthat.’ But he believed he could do it and even enacted the scene of his greatest individual\\ntriumph that was to come nearly 20 years later – he fashioned a trophy-like vessel out of a\\ncheap plastic vase and, speaking English for one of the first times in his life, raised the\\nvase above his head with the words, ‘Hello, I’m Novak Djokovic, I’m Wimbledon\\nchampion.’\\nThe precocity of the young Novak was spotted by a man who was later to become a\\nDavis Cup team-mate and one of his coaches, Dusan Vemic. Vemic, 11 years older than\\nDjokovic, was still in the youth squad at the Partizan club in Belgrade when he found his\\nsquad coaching sessions taking place on a neighbouring court to one being used by\\nGencic to coach the seven-year-old Djokovic. ‘Even at that stage, he was almost\\nindependent in some way,’ recalls Vemic. ‘You could see he was like those kids brought\\non to TV shows as little prodigies in different spheres of life – maths, music – they’re like\\nlittle professors. He was one of those kids: very intelligent, very eloquent, great ideas, very\\nclear in his head. He had something about him and the whole situation brought out more\\nfrom him. The tougher the situation, the better he is. He’s proved that over and over as a\\nprofessional.’\\nAlthough he was spending three-quarters of the year in Belgrade, Djokovic thought of\\nKopaonik as his tennis home. He would play on the three hard courts in summer and, in\\nwinter, when those courts were covered with snow, he would profit from the indoor sports\\nfacility at the Grand Hotel, which had been built by the state tourism authorities in the\\n1980s and could be used as an indoor tennis court. Together with the clay courts of the\\nBelgrade facilities, it gave him access to hard, clay and indoor surfaces, so a well-rounded\\ntennis education. But it wasn’t all tennis – Gencic wanted all the boys and girls on her\\ncamps to \\nsocialise together, so it was a massive youthful community with all the\\nfriendships and frictions that go with it. Reminiscing with Gencic in his twenties, Djokovic\\nsaid to her, ‘You know, Jeca, Kopaonik is my Mount Olympus.’\\n \\nDjokovic refers to Gencic as his ‘tennis mother’, and having coached him from when he\\nwas five until he was twelve, she certainly taught him the fundamentals of tennis. But she\\nsaw her role as much wider than that.\\nIf the term hadn’t been commandeered by a branch of the personal development\\nindustry, you could describe Gencic as Djokovic’s life coach, in the sense that she\\ncoached him in various aspects of life that she knew he would have to deal with. She\\ntaught him about table manners; she recognised that the family he came from had just\\nabout enough to live on but no more, but that as a top-level tennis player he would sit at\\ntables with more than one knife and one fork, more than one glass, so she told him which\\nglass was for the aperitif, which for the white wine, which for the champagne, etc.\\nMindful of the pride involved in a patriarchal family where a woman had come in to\\ncoach the eldest son in a discipline the family was unfamiliar with, Gencic insisted she\\nonly ever told him about table manners and such like when they were alone. And only\\nonce did Djokovic ask me why she was telling him about etiquette. ‘Every day I told him,\\n“You will be the best in the world,” starting from the second day I knew him. I said we must\\nwork, we must believe each other. If you don’t understand something, you must ask me. If\\nyou feel you haven’t put the work in, put it in. I told his parents, “Don’t put pressure on your',\n",
       " 'child, he has to be an individual. The motivation has to come from him.” But these kinds of\\nthings I said privately, so Novak didn’t hear what I told his parents and his parents didn’t\\nhear everything I told him.’\\nAs well as etiquette, Gencic was very big into music, literature and general education.\\nOne day she told him she liked classical music and, when she was tired, she would lie\\ndown and listen to some. She suggested he did the same and introduced him to some of\\nthe classics. She said,\\nI always explained who the composer was. I explained if it was baroque, classical,\\nromantic, who Beethoven was, etc. What we listened to depended on his tiredness\\nand level of interest. When he was very tired, we listened to Chopin, Debussy, Grieg –\\npiano music to which we can slowly relax. And very often because we often finished\\nthe day near my home, I played pieces on the piano for him. The first time he was\\nlistening, I saw in his eyes that he would prefer to listen to heavy metal and such like\\nbut I said he had to learn to listen to classical as well. He would listen to rock and\\nheavy metal for half an hour before he went to bed, so he had both. I never said, ‘Don’t\\ndo it.’ That’s a terrible thing to say to a youngster.\\nOne day, when he was about seven, I was very tired, maybe a bit depressed, and\\nwas looking for a piece of music to put on. I like to listen to strong music, full orchestra\\nmusic, so I played the 1812 Overture – for myself. And I saw him – he was listening, so\\nI turned the volume up a little. Suddenly Novak told me, ‘Jeca, I’ve got goose bumps.’\\nHe was listening so strongly. I said, ‘OK, Novak, I’ll explain something very important.\\nIn a match, you’ll be in one of two situations. It could be a very good situation where\\nyou’re closing in on victory, one or two points away from winning, and you’ll feel\\ngoose bumps. In that situation, be quiet and finish the match, don’t get excited, stay\\ncalm. But you may be a few points from losing a match, so remember this music and\\nthe feeling, remember both, and the adrenalin will start to kick in and you may well\\nwin.’ I think this lesson has been so important for his mental strength.\\nAlongside the poets – particularly Serbian and Russian ones – Gencic encouraged\\nDjokovic to learn at least two languages other than his mother tongue. English was an\\nobvious one and he chose German as his second, which came in useful when he began\\ngoing to Munich at the age of 12.\\nAnd she taught Djokovic about Nikola Tesla. To most travellers, Tesla is just the name\\nof Belgrade’s international airport but the man himself was a leading, if somewhat\\neccentric, figure in the history of science. A Serb who emigrated to America, he is credited\\nwith being the father of alternating current, the AC in AC/DC (DC stands for direct current),\\nand some credit him with the science underlying the major discoveries associated with\\nEdison, Marconi and others. Gencic knew a lot about Tesla and one day found an article\\nabout him in a newspaper that had a good cultural section for children. Djokovic, then\\nabout seven and a half, was very interested and asked her a question about Tesla. Gencic\\nreplied with, ‘What’s the first idea of Nikola Tesla? Answer: visualisation. First Tesla saw\\nin his mind a new idea, then he put it down on paper and then tried to realise it.’ Only once\\ndid Djokovic ask her what ‘visualisation’ means. He asked, ‘Do you think you will see into\\nthe future what will happen?’ – this at seven. Gencic explained that, for tennis tactics,\\nvisualisation is a very important part of practice. So she played Smetana’s symphonic\\npoem \\nVltava\\n to him, saying he should listen, and when she stopped the music he had to\\ntell her what he saw, what he felt and anything else about the music – in short, what he\\nvisualised. Then Gencic shared with him what she had been feeling. She admits to one',\n",
       " 'mistake with \\nVltava\\n – she told him it was a river but that was because she felt a seven-\\nyear-old needed a helping hand, \\nwhich this particular seven-year-old probably didn’t. At\\ntimes they visualised with a different piece of music every day, which explains why\\nDjokovic has a very good knowledge of classical music and still uses it to calm his mind\\ntoday.\\nThe Gencic teaching extended to aspects of nature as and when they encountered them.\\nShe once offered her summer group in Kopaonik the option of a training session or a four-\\nhour walk in the mountains – they all, including Djokovic, opted for the walk in the\\nmountains. She told them about the fauna and flora, often explaining why she liked\\nsomething. She taught him what to pick to make up a small bouquet. One day, when he\\nwas about nine, he made a really big and beautiful bouquet; an impressed Gencic\\ncomplimented him and picked a blue flower that she felt would go well in it. He looked and\\nsaid, ‘But Jeca, don’t you see? I have this flower in there already.’ Indeed he had, she just\\nhadn’t noticed, and stood corrected. It transpired it was his mother’s birthday that day and it\\nwas clearly important to him that he should make his own bouquet for her free from any\\noutside influence.\\nAnd, of course, as the niece of a leading artist, the broad education included art. This\\nwas a message the young Novace picked up very quickly (in the first few months Gencic\\ncalled him ‘Novace’, pronounced ‘No-VA-chay’). When he was seven and a half and her\\nbirthday was approaching, he insisted to his parents that he wanted to buy her a present –\\na painting. He spent two hours looking for the right one and eventually found it in a market.\\nIt hung in her living room until her death, among the more critically acclaimed Marinkovic\\nworks.\\nTo what extent Djokovic would have been the person he is without the influence of\\nJelena Gencic will never be known. He clearly had the confidence to take in her wide-\\nranging package of education, and the intellectual capacity to know where she was\\ncoming from and why what she was teaching him would help him in the future. Given the\\ndetermination it takes to get to the top of a ferociously competitive global sport, it’s distinctly\\npossible Djokovic would have had a much rockier road to the top without her input. He\\nmight have pursued a route similar to Andre Agassi’s – Agassi’s natural curiosity and good\\nnature eventually triumphed over the rebelliousness of his unchannelled youthful\\naggression, but it took many years and may well have cost him half a dozen Grand Slam\\nsingles titles.\\nFrom the beginning, Gencic had an unshakeable belief that Djokovic would be the best\\nin the world, so she saw her role as teaching him to speak very well as much as teaching\\nhim a good backhand, encouraging him to speak good English as much as encouraging\\nhim to go to the net, and to be very helpful and diplomatic. She maintained he loves\\neverybody – he probably doesn’t, but he does a good job of making those with whom he\\ncomes into contact feel very loved.\\n \\nThe relationship between a coach and a player is a strange one. Some coaches are\\nanathema to some players but a match made in heaven with others. It takes a certain\\nchemistry, perhaps allied to the right timing. For some players, Gencic might have been a\\ndisaster – maybe there is a potential champion who missed the boat because he or she\\nhad a Gencic figure, rather than a more traditional nuts-and-bolts coach. But she was so\\nright for Djokovic.\\nAnd even in what proved to be the last few months of her life, she never described\\nherself as a professional coach. ‘I’m not professional because that means you work for',\n",
       " 'money but I never work for money,’ she said. ‘I don’t want money because I coach children.\\nIf their parents have no money, I still want to coach them. For most of my life, the tennis\\ncourts were excellent in Yugoslavia \\nand Serbia because the government paid for\\neverything in a tennis school. We could buy balls through the tennis school, rackets and\\nstrings, and the state paid for coaching.’\\nIn some ways, she was a loveable eccentric. Even in her mid-70s she spent up to 10\\nhours a day on court, coaching and supervising other coaches, and there was no shortage\\nof children who wanted to learn. Every day she would break for her unchanging lunch of a\\nbaguette and a litre of yoghurt. One year, on her birthday, all her children and their parents\\ngave her a baguette and a litre of yoghurt as an affectionate joke.\\nOfficially, she was Djokovic’s first coach: the woman who taught him how to play tennis.\\nFrom when he was 12, when he had other coaches in Belgrade and visited Nikki Pilic’s\\nacademy in Germany at regular intervals, she became just a friend and ex-coach. He\\nfrequently visited her, but once he was full-time on the tour, he had less and less time to\\nsee her. There was a period of about four years in his early adulthood when he didn’t see\\nher at all. She said she fully understood, though there was a sense that she was a little\\nupset by the length of time she didn’t see him. During that period, Djokovic had the habit of\\nmentioning a work of classical music in some of his interviews for Serbian television or\\nradio. Sometimes he would say, ‘I like to listen to Tchaikovsky,’ or another classical\\ncomposer. Gencic interpreted this as Djokovic telling her through television that he was\\nthinking of her, even if he didn’t have time to contact her. Djokovic confirmed in an\\ninterview with her that this was how he intended it – whether he was just being nice to an\\nold lady for whom he clearly felt immense affection and gratitude is not certain, but it would\\nbe nice to believe such references to the classics genuinely were coded messages sent to\\nher.\\nAnother thing she never said but seemed to hint at was that she was sad never to have\\ntravelled with him. The family frequently \\nstruggled to find money for tickets, but\\noccasionally there was a budget for Novak to go to a junior tournament with one\\naccompanying adult. So the question was always who would go with him and it was\\nalways his father or mother, or Uncle Goran or Bogdan Obradovic – never Gencic,\\nalthough he would sometimes talk on the phone to her. Only once did Djokovic ever invite\\nher to accompany him to a tournament. That was for the first day of Wimbledon 2012 when\\nhe was opening the defence of his title at 1pm on the first day and he invited her to sit with\\nhis team in the players’ box. She said she replied, ‘Novak, if you’re only inviting me for one\\nday, I think it’s much better if it’s the last day, not the first.’ So she didn’t come and Djokovic\\nnever made it to the final – he was beaten by Roger Federer in the semis and, by the\\nfollowing year’s Wimbledon, she was dead.\\nBut if she never travelled to Wimbledon, Wimbledon came to her. At the end of the 2011\\nseason, Djokovic arranged to visit her and asked if he could bring along a TV crew. In the\\nend he brought two – one American and one Serbian – so both Serbian and US television\\ncaptured the moment when Djokovic walked through the gate of her house with his\\nWimbledon replica. ‘This was what we were working for, wasn’t it?’ he said as they gave\\neach other a heartfelt hug – he in a warm winter overcoat, she in a cricket sweater. ‘This is\\nthe trophy, this was our dream. We were standing in front of the mirror and lifting up the\\nimprovised trophy and dreaming of holding this one one day. I always wanted to do this,’\\nhe said as he placed his replica on the table containing all her trophies, ‘alongside your\\ntrophies – not just any trophy, but the one, \\nthe\\n one.’ It was a wonderful moment, not\\ncheapened in any way by the presence of the cameras.',\n",
       " 'That wasn’t the last time they saw each other but it was a form of closure. And the end\\ncame suddenly. She was on court until a week before she rapidly went down with the\\nspread of her \\nsecondary liver cancer, and she died on the middle Saturday of the 2013\\nFrench Open. Word went out on the Serbian Tennis Federation’s website at noon that day,\\nbut with Djokovic due to play Grigor Dimitrov late that afternoon in the third round in Paris,\\nDjokovic’s coach and team decided to keep the news from him. After beating Dimitrov\\ncomfortably, he did a cheerful on-court interview with Fabrice Santoro, signed a few\\nautographs as he left the court, and was then given the news.\\nNormally a post-match press conference is obligatory but he was exempted all his media\\nobligations that night. Two days later, after winning his next match, he said of the previous\\n48 hours:\\nIt hasn’t been easy but this is life – life gives you things and takes away close people.\\nJelena was my first coach, she was like my second mother – we were very close\\nthroughout all my life. She taught me a lot of things that are part of me, part of my\\ncharacter today. I have the nicest memories of her. This is something that will stay with\\nme for ever and, hopefully, I will be able to continue and follow up where she stopped\\nwith her legacy because she left so much knowledge to me and to the people who\\nwere close to her and I feel the responsibility to continue doing that in the future. She\\nworked with kids from about five and six years to 12 and 13 years old, and she\\ndedicated all her life to that generation and to tennis. She never got married, she never\\nhad kids, so tennis was all she had in life. Even last week she was giving lessons to\\nkids, so she didn’t really care about the nature of the illness – she had breast cancer\\nand she survived that. She’s one of the most incredible people I ever knew, so it’s\\nquite emotional, yeah.\\nThe Serbian Tennis Federation hastily organised a service of \\nthanksgiving in Belgrade for\\nGencic’s life. It took place two days after her death, on the second Monday of Roland\\nGarros, so there was no way Djokovic could be there. But he sent a letter, which his mother\\nread out at the service. It included the passage,\\nI am completely unprepared for our parting. Not being able to see you off makes me\\nendlessly sad. Still, I know that you’d be mad if I gave up or decreased my chance to\\nfulfil this final wish of ours, winning Roland Garros. Thank you for your patience, your\\nenormous love. Thank you for your everyday support, for the advice I remember, for\\nthe warm words which always carried an extraordinary message. You know that I’ve\\nmemorised them all and that I always follow your rules.\\nOur last conversation, two weeks ago, didn’t suggest that any-thing was wrong. I’m\\nsad because even then you made an effort to keep me free from any concerns and\\nassured me that everything was all right, that you were in the hospital for a routine\\ncheck-up – that I shouldn’t worry but win.\\nYou were an angel. Both when you coached me and afterward, I felt your support\\nwherever I went. Sincere. Strong. Unconditional. You left an indelible mark on Serbian\\ntennis. Everyone who holds a racket in his or her hands today is indebted to you. I\\npromise that I will speak your name to future generations and that your spirit will live\\non on our tennis courts.\\nIf this was a fairy tale, Djokovic would have won the French Open seven days later. But it\\nisn’t, and he didn’t. He was beaten by Rafael Nadal in a four-hour, 38-minute semi-final in',\n",
       " 'which he had his chances but, ultimately, couldn’t resist the irrepressible momentum that\\nNadal had created after seven months off the tour in 2012–13. If Gencic was Djokovic’s\\nangel, she was off guardian duty that \\nafternoon. But it’s hard not to see Djokovic having\\nthree or four more cracks at the French Open title and maybe winning it will mean just as\\nmuch a little further down the line.\\n \\nIn many ways, the person of Novak Djokovic, more than the tennis player, is Jelena\\nGencic’s legacy. She didn’t seem to mind not having had children of her own, saying, ‘All\\nboys and girls are my children,’ but it was easy to feel she would have made a wonderfully\\nnurturing mother. If Djokovic was the son she never had, he’s the kind of son any mother\\nwould be proud of. Yet perhaps she needed him too much. She said she’d had two very\\ntalented boys a couple of years after she met him but she didn’t want to work with them,\\nostensibly because she didn’t have time, what with coaching Djokovic and her TV work,\\nbut deep down she didn’t want to create competition for him. ‘I wanted to keep him to be\\nthe best in his own right,’ was how she put it. Such devotion, though admirable, can be\\nstifling, and maybe Djokovic needed to get his distance from her, which may explain the\\nfour years in which they never saw each other.\\nThere was something inspiring yet sad about Jelena Gencic. Her eyes sparkled with\\nenthusiasm, yet there was also a sadness there. If she had one regret as a professional, it\\nwas that there is very little left of her work as a television-programme maker. She ended\\nher TV career in 1999 when the Serbian television centre was destroyed in the Nato\\nbombing; the bombing destroyed the archives, so most of the 1,500 programmes she\\nmade, many of them award winners, were obliterated.\\nIf she had ever been marooned on the BBC’s fictitious ‘desert island’ (from the long-\\nrunning radio series \\nDesert Island Discs\\n) with nothing to keep her company except eight\\npieces of music, she would have wanted a Beethoven symphony (any one would do), the\\nAdagietto from Mahler’s fifth symphony, Rachmaninov’s C minor \\npiano concerto, some\\nChopin piano music and some Serbian national and church music, plus a bit of music she\\nhad composed for her television work. But knowing her, she would probably have captured\\na baboon and spent most of her time trying to teach it how to hit a coconut shell over a low\\nhorizontal branch.\\nAs Djokovic summed it up, her biggest legacy is simply her own personal ethos and\\nemotional intelligence, which distinguishes her massively from your average tennis coach.\\n‘If I give everything from my soul to a child on a tennis court,’ she said in her last interview,\\n‘this boy or girl must receive it – maybe not all of it but much of it. If they don’t receive it,\\nthat’s no motivation for me. I am very proud of Novak. This is a boy who understands me,\\nwho learned so much, who wanted to learn so much, who wanted to receive from me. And I\\nreceived from him too. The biggest thing I’ve learned is to be patient. Never be sad, explain\\nif you’re feeling sad, explain to yourself and speak to each other about it. It’s very\\nimportant.’\\nInterviewed for this book in early 2014, Djokovic looked back on the role Gencic played\\nfor him. ‘Jelena had a vision,’ he said. ‘She saw in me something special from the start.\\nShe was always preparing each of us for something greater than the game of tennis. She\\nwas preparing us for life. My family taught me to always be respectful and polite to people\\nolder than me. She was my coach, somebody who my parents chose to be my guide and\\nmentor. I never questioned her methods and ways to transfer her knowledge to me. I was\\nlike a sponge and I was only asking for more and she was happy to give me all she could.\\nAs I said, she had a vision in how to shape me into a good person and good player – and',\n",
       " 'that would have applied even if I had only been known within Serbia, nobody made any\\nguarantees that I would be a top athlete of the future, travelling around the world and\\nrepresenting my country. Even though she passed away last year during Roland Garros,\\nshe still feels very alive \\nto me. She is part of each of my training sessions, each win, loss…\\nI just don’t think that people like her can pass away. She is beyond physical life. I am\\neternally grateful for having her in my life as a tennis mother.’',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER FOUR\\nTHE EMERGENCE OF SERBIA FROM THE YUGOSLAV\\nWARS\\nI\\nt’s hard to find a country that does not have some stain on its historical character. Some\\nare easy to highlight, like Germany, a culturally mature country that has produced Goethe,\\nBeethoven and Dürer but was still capable of starting two world wars and inflicting awful\\nsuffering on a group of people simply because of their ethnic origin. Russia’s part in its war\\nagainst Japan in 1904–5 was as awful as it was stupid, sending its Baltic fleet around the\\nworld in a nine-month manoeuvre to preserve the Tsar’s prestige, only for it to be sunk in\\n45 minutes in the Tsushima Strait; Russia also has Stalin’s show trials and purges of the\\n1930s on its record. Rwanda has the horrendous genocide of 1994, Chile has its Pinochet\\nera, South Africa the apartheid era. The USA has had its fair share of dodgy deals with\\nunsavoury regimes, plus its slowness to afford non-white Americans their rights under the\\nUS constitution. And a close examination of British foreign policy over the past 200 years\\nshows \\nup all sorts of things the great empire builders wouldn’t want publicised, like the first\\nconcentration camps in the Boer War, the Amritsar massacre of 1919 and other low-profile\\nexamples of colonial arrogance and despotism.\\nAll this and more should be stated before laying too strongly into Serbia for its actions in\\nthe 1990s. But there’s no doubt it was an era in Serbian history that the likes of Novak\\nDjokovic do not reflect comfortably on. He has often spoken about how part of his\\nstatesmanlike role is to convince the world that Serbs are not all the bloodthirsty louts they\\nwere frequently depicted as on the world’s television screens in the 1990s, as Yugoslavia\\nbroke up in a wave of bloodshed. ‘I’m very conscious of that in every moment of both my\\npublic and private life,’ he says, ‘especially when I am abroad. It is something that is built-\\nin with most of us Serbs of my generation and older. We were always told that once we go\\nout of the country, there will be a lot of stereotypes attached to us because we come from\\nSerbia. They will think a lot of nasty and bad things, and we need to be very conscious\\nabout our behaviour. We are the ambassadors of our families and our country, and we\\nneed to always show the best in us. So I carry this responsibility with big respect and\\nhonour, and I hope that I am managing to portray my country in the best possible light.’\\nThe tragedy of the Yugoslav wars is that they should never have been necessary. There\\nis a view among some ethnologists that the Serbian approach to nationhood in 1918 was\\nan inclusive one – that those peoples related to the Serbs through a closeness of language\\nand religion (whether practised religion or just a label of identification with a faith) could\\neasily belong in the same country, be it a ‘Greater Serbia’ or a ‘Yugoslavia’. Not everyone\\nwould agree with this view but it is undeniable that there is generally an ease of relations\\nbetween Serbs, Montenegrins, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians and others on a personal\\nlevel, and the fact that the \\nlanguage spoken in Yugoslavia was generally known as ‘Serbo-\\nCroat’ is a reflection of how close Serbian and Croatian are.\\nYet by 1990 antagonisms between the constituent republics of Yugoslavia had reached\\nthe point where you were ‘either with us or against us’. This was bad enough in the five\\nrepublics that reflected an ethnically recognisable people: Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro,\\nSlovenia and Macedonia. It was even worse in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a small state that',\n",
       " 'didn’t really have ethnic Bosnians. The largest constituent ethnic group of Bosnians were\\nMuslim (known as Bosniaks) but with a good number of Serbs and Croats. It was here that\\nthe tragic neighbour-versus-neighbour violence – when friends and neighbours who had\\nrecently celebrated festivals together suddenly turned against each other – was at its worst\\nand left a legacy that the new republics are still recovering from today.\\nThe break-up of Yugoslavia happened in the course of four wars concentrated largely\\naround the areas where the different ethnic groups were most mixed. It’s important to\\nunderstand the difference between how the terms ‘republic’ and ‘nation’ are used in this\\npart of the world – Croatia is the republic, the Croats are the nation; Serbia the republic,\\nSerbs the nation, etc. This was a battle of nations and what happened was the emergence\\nof nationalism over citizenship, or what is often known as ‘state chauvinism’. Instead of a\\ngovernment trying to serve all the citizens in its area of jurisdiction regardless of ethnic or\\nreligious origin, the new governments were looking to rule on behalf of the majority\\n‘nation’. That inevitably relegated those who were not of the majority nation to minorities,\\nnormally discriminated against and treated as second-class citizens.\\nSome put the starting point of the wars at Tito’s death in 1980 and the chain of events\\nthat led to the wars of 1991–99 can certainly be traced back to then. But the point at which\\nwar became inevitable was probably reached in the late 1980s, when Slobodan Milosevic\\nrealised the political benefit that Serb nationalism was \\nlikely to deliver. Acting as president\\nof the Yugoslav republic of Serbia (not then a sovereign state the way today’s Serbia is),\\nMilosevic in 1989 rescinded the autonomy of the mainly Albanian province of Kosovo and\\nbegan a programme of imposing Serbian culture. The move sent shock waves through the\\nCroats and Slovenes. They feared they would be next and, when the 14th congress of the\\nYugoslav Communist Party voted in January 1990 for a multi-party system, the nationalist\\nparties seized the initiative.\\nBy the start of 1991 it was clear Yugoslavia was going to break up, but the Karadjordjevo\\nagreement between Milosevic and the equally fervent Croatian nationalist leader Franjo\\nTudjman in March 1991 meant that a bitter struggle over the ethnically mixed areas would\\nfollow. This agreement set out how both men saw the dissolution of Yugoslavia, effectively\\nby dividing Bosnia between them.\\nThree of the four wars overlapped. Skirmishes in the Serbo-Croat war of 1991–95 had\\nbegun in the early spring but in June Slovenia declared independence. For 10 days,\\nSerbia, in the form of the Yugoslav National Army, tried to bring the Slovenes back but they\\nsoon gave up and Slovenia gained its independence before the summer was out. This was\\nthe first of the wars, sometimes referred to as ‘the 10-day War’.\\nThat spurred Croatia and Macedonia to declare their independence. The Croats had\\nalready signalled that they wanted to secede and had prepared a constitution for the new\\nsovereign Republic of Croatia. That constitution reclassified the Serbs living in Croatia –\\nabout 12 per cent of the population, most of them living in the province of Krajina near the\\nSerbian border – as a ‘national minority’ when, up till then, they had been a ‘constituent\\nnation’. As Serbia’s approach under Milosevic had been that non-Serb nations could have\\ntheir own republics but that all Serbs were entitled to belong to ‘Greater Serbia’, the\\nCroatian Serbs announced \\ntheir secession from Croatia in the hope of integration into the\\nnew Serbian state.\\nThat triggered the second of the wars, often referred to as the ‘Croatian War of\\nIndependence’, although the Croatian Serbs prefer to view it as their battle for self-\\ndetermination; some call it the ‘Serbo-Croat War’ but that can be misleading because\\nethnic Serbs and Croats clashed in Bosnia too. Because of the involvement of the largely',\n",
       " 'Serbian Yugoslav National Army, which marched around 70,000 soldiers into Croatia, the\\ninitial victories went to the Serbs. The first act of ethnic cleansing took place that summer in\\nthe town of Kijevo, where Croats were rounded up and shot simply because they were\\nCroats, but more ethnic cleansing followed. One particular name, Vukovar, became a\\nsymbol for the whole Serbo-Croat war. It was a peaceful town just inside the Croatia-\\nSerbia border of around 50,000 inhabitants of mixed ethnic origin – some say there were\\n22 different nations represented among Vukovar’s residents, making it a model Yugoslav\\ntown. By July 1991 Vukovar was surrounded by the Serbs, who bombarded it for four\\nmonths; it eventually fell to the Serbs in November 1991 as hundreds of Croat patients\\nwere herded from a hospital, taken to a field and shot. Four years later, with the Croats\\nsurging west, making good the territorial losses they had suffered in the early months of the\\nwar, Vukovar was retaken and the Serbs had to flee. Vukovar is less than 20km from\\nVinkovici, where Dijana Djokovic’s family hails from.\\nThe bloodiest of the four wars was the ‘Bosnian War’ of 1992–95. Bosnia-Herzegovina\\nwas the only one of the six Yugoslav republics not to have a distinct resident nation. The\\nethnic mix was approximately 43 per cent Bosniak (Muslim), 31 per cent Serb and 17 per\\ncent Croat. The early part of the war saw the Serb-dominated Yugoslav National Army\\nbombard Bosniak territory, carrying out ethnic cleansing by killing large numbers of\\nBosnian \\nMuslims. But there were also clashes between Bosniaks and Croats, and clashes\\nwithin sub-groups of the ethnic nations.\\nThe Bosnian War lasted three and a half years and led to an estimated 100,000 deaths,\\nwith up to 50,000 women raped and around 2.2 million becoming refugees or otherwise\\ndisplaced. Most of the names that stand out from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s are from\\nthe Bosnian War, largely because it was so brutal. The Bosnian Serbs were led by\\nRadovan Karadzic, with the Bosnian Serb military commanded by Ratko Mladic – both\\nwere indicted at the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal in The Hague. Several place names\\nbecame recurring terms in the world’s news coverage – like Mostar for the destruction of its\\n427-year-old symbolic bridge, or Banja Luka for the concentration camp the Serbs set up\\nthere. But perhaps the two names that symbolise the war were Sarajevo and Srebrenica.\\nSarajevo, the Bosnian capital, had hosted the winter Olympics in 1984 but was badly\\ndamaged in a siege that began in April 1992 after Bosnia’s Muslim president Alja\\nIzetbegovic declared independence from Yugoslavia. That independence was promptly\\nrecognised by the international community, causing the Serbs to mobilise their forces\\naround the city. The siege lasted longer than the war itself, not ending until February 1996.\\nSrebrenica was a small town of about 8,000 inhabitants but that population had swollen to\\naround 40,000 because of all the Bosniaks fleeing ethnic cleansing. Supposedly under the\\nprotection of the United Nations, it was shelled and ransacked by Serb forces on Easter\\nMonday 1993, leaving dozens dead. The UN declared it a ‘safe zone’ but insufficient\\nmilitary protection was provided and in July 1995 Serb forces captured the supposedly\\ndemilitarised town and slaughtered an estimated 8,500 Bosnian men. This was the\\nepisode that later caused the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal in The Hague to declare the\\nkilling as genocide, and to censure Serbia for failure to prevent it.\\nThe Bosnian war came to an end when Nato intervened, bombing Serbian positions in\\nBosnia in August and September 1995. It was concluded with the Dayton peace accords of\\nNovember 1995, which established various ethnic rights within the borders of new\\nindependent states. The peace has held but almost in the form of a mini-Yugoslavia within\\nBosnian borders, such that national successes like qualifying for the 2014 football World\\nCup are never the source of unified national rejoicing they would be in most other',\n",
       " 'countries.\\nSo by the end of 1995, Slovenia, Macedonia, Croatia and Bosnia had all declared\\nindependence. It meant that Yugoslavia was now only Serbia and Montenegro. Yet it\\ncontinued under the name Yugoslavia, and in 1997 Slobodan Milosevic moved up from\\nbeing president of Serbia to being president of Yugoslavia. And he was not finished with\\nhis nationalist wars.\\nThe fourth war came in 1998 and centred on Kosovo. This is a conflict rich in symbolism,\\nwhich embodies many of the factors that cause territorial struggles in a world where travel\\n– and thus migration – is so easy. It is also the war that has the greatest impact on the\\nDjokovic story.\\nThe defeat of Kosovo in 1389 marked the end of Serbia’s great era of dominance in the\\nMiddle Ages and the start of the rise of the Ottoman Empire. So Kosovo had always been a\\npoignant reminder of Serbian failure. It had remained a province of Serbia but it was never\\na massively prosperous area and, from the middle of the 20th century, the Serbs tended to\\nmove north where economic prospects were better. As the Serbs moved north, ethnic\\nAlbanians moved in. These Muslim migrants, referred to by the Serbs as ‘Siptar’ (very\\nmuch a term of abuse), often bought land from the departing Serbs. More importantly, they\\nhad a phenomenally high birth rate, with the result that by the start of the 1990s Kosovo\\nhad a majority ethnic Albanian population.\\nFor most of the four decades of Tito’s Yugoslavia, Kosovo had the \\nstatus of an\\nautonomous province, but this was rescinded by Milosevic in 1989. Not only that but Serb\\nculture was imposed – Albanian radio and television were closed, Albanian teachers were\\nforbidden from teaching in schools and colleges and Albanians were fired from jobs in\\npublic-sector industries (which accounted for most industries at that time). In 1996\\ndisaffected Albanians formed the Kosovo Liberation Army, which started attacking Serbia.\\nAn agreement of sorts was reached in 1998 but it was never going to hold because the\\nethnic Albanian population wanted independence for Kosovo while Milosevic wanted it to\\nremain part of Serbia.\\nThe ‘Kosovo War’ began in 1998. The bloodshed intensified, to the point where Nato\\nordered Serbia to stop its attacks in Kosovo. Serbia refused, probably believing Nato had\\nno mandate to intervene as Kosovo was a legally constituted province of Yugoslavia. But\\nas evidence emerged of more massacres of innocent civilians, Nato eventually responded\\nby launching bombing raids on both Kosovo and Belgrade. For 76 days, from 24 March to\\n8 June 1999, Belgrade came under air attack, forcing its residents to flee to underground\\nshelters, including the Djokovic family. Eventually, Serbia accepted the United Nations’\\noffer for Kosovo to become a province under UN protection and the war ended.\\nKosovo remained a UN-protected province for nine years. Then in 2008 it declared\\nindependence. It was recognised by most of the international community but a few states –\\nnotably Russia, China and five EU members – supported Serbia by not recognising\\nKosovo as a sovereign state. In April 2013 the EU brokered a deal under which the Serbs\\nin northern Kosovo are guaranteed a community of Serb municipalities in both the north\\nand the south of Kosovo; Belgrade denied that the deal meant Serbia recognised Kosovo’s\\nindependence, saying it was just to regularise the situation in the short term so both Serbia\\nand Albania could negotiate their accession to the EU.\\nThese days no more than about 10 per cent of Kosovo’s population is Serb but the\\nSerbs still form a majority in about a quarter of Kosovo’s land – around the city of Mitrovica\\nwhere Srdjan Djokovic, Novak’s father, grew up. The Serb-Albanian tensions continue to\\nsimmer but, with the two countries wanting to join the European Union and the EU saying',\n",
       " 'this can only happen with ‘full normalisation’ of relations (whatever that comes to mean in\\npractice), some lasting solution needs to be found. As part of ‘full normalisation’, the EU\\nhas insisted that Serbia should cooperate in bringing the last two war-crimes suspects\\n(Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic) to justice. Meanwhile, Kosovo exists in a sort of limbo –\\na state recognised by many but not by enough to become a United Nations member. This\\nmeans, for example, that it can’t join Uefa or Fifa, so a football player such as Manchester\\nUnited’s Adnan Januzaj, whose parents are ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, couldn’t play\\nfor Kosovo in international competitions if he wanted to – except in friendly matches – as\\nKosovo isn’t admitted (ironically, Januzaj could choose to play for either Serbia or Albania\\nby dint of having Kosovan parents).\\nIt could well be that the ethnic Serbs in Kosovo will eventually join Serbia as part of a\\nfinal settlement that will see Belgrade recognising Kosovan independence. Whether\\nKosovo then seeks to be part of a larger Albania is not yet on the agenda but it might be at\\nsome stage. What seems most likely is that Serbia and Albania will both end up as\\nmembers of the EU and the resulting economic interdependence between the two might\\nwell lead to the evolution of a more peaceful solution, whether that involves a sovereign\\nKosovan state or not.\\n \\nThe four Yugoslav civil wars of the 1990s became the subject of various judicial hearings\\ninto war crimes held under a specially constituted UN court, the International Criminal\\nTribunal for the \\nformer Yugoslavia (or ICTY). It met in the Dutch city of The Hague, the seat\\nof the International Criminal Court, and was also known as the Hague War Crimes\\nTribunal. A string of guilty verdicts early on suggested the tribunal was sending out tough\\nsignals about what was acceptable in the theatre of war, but a run of not-guilty verdicts on\\ntechnicalities in recent years has cast doubt on how strong the signals will prove in the\\nlong term. The tribunal was supposed to have concluded all its work by the end of 2014 but\\nthe late captures of Mladic and Hadzic mean it will probably not wrap up until 2016 or\\n2017.\\nThe tribunal’s most eye-catching conclusion was that some of the atrocities did\\nconstitute genocide. Genocide was defined in the 1948 Genocide Convention (UN\\nGeneral Assembly resolution 260) as an act ‘committed with intent to destroy, in whole or\\nin part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group’ but, until the Yugoslav war-crimes\\ntribunal, no state had ever been found to be in breach of the convention. The ICTY found\\nSerbia not guilty of direct involvement in genocide, but it did become the first country to be\\ncriticised for a breach of international law by failing to prevent the genocide committed in\\nSrebrenica in 1995. The tribunal indicted 161 persons under the Genocide Convention\\nand convicted 69 of them for genocide or lesser war crimes. But the most high-profile\\ndefendant, Slobodan Milosevic, escaped justice when he was found dead in his cell in\\n2006. The assumption has been that he took his life but no definitive cause of death has\\never been proven. Whether suicide, sudden illness or murder, his death robbed the world\\nof a verdict in a rare trial of a head of state for atrocities committed under his rule.\\nThroughout the period in which the tribunal did its work, Serbia and the other former\\nYugoslav nations rebuilt their badly damaged countries. In 2003 Serbia and Montenegro\\ndropped the pretence of being Yugoslavia and called themselves ‘Serbia & Montenegro’ in\\na \\nthree-year deal that would culminate in a Montenegrin referendum on independence. In\\n2006 the Montenegrins narrowly voted for it, thereby ending the break-up of Yugoslavia\\nthat had started in 1991 and taken 15 bloody years. In that time, more than 140,000 people\\nare believed to have lost their lives in the wars, based on estimates by international',\n",
       " 'humanitarian agencies.\\nThere’s no doubt that Serbia emerged from the break-up of Yugoslavia with the lion’s\\nshare of the blame. The belligerent figure of Slobodan Milosevic probably has a lot to do\\nwith that, and a 1994 UN report said Serbia was trying to create a Greater Serbia, rather\\nthan trying to restore Yugoslavia. The war-crimes tribunal also said the majority of the\\ncasualties were victims of Serbian aggression, and there are accounts that Serbs who\\nargued for a tempering of Serbian nationalism were often harassed, hounded and even\\nkilled. Yet is it really fair to tag the Serbs as the only villains, even if statistics suggest they\\nwere the biggest culprits in the four wars? Croatia’s nationalism too was always\\n‘exclusive’, there are plenty of tales of the Muslim community of Bosnia whipping itself into\\na frenzy, and while the Muslims and Croats did indeed suffer in Bosnia at the hands of\\nSerb nationalists, in the 1941–45 civil war it had been largely the Serbs who had suffered\\nat the hands of the brutal Croatian fascists, the Ustase, and, to a lesser extent, the Muslim\\nBosnians. It makes it understandable but still tragically unnecessary. It would be wrong to\\nspend too much time in this book on the question of blame, yet it is fair to say that a view of\\nthe Yugoslav wars that says it was all down to Serbian aggression, and that the Croats,\\nBosnians and others were innocent victims, is oversimplistic in the extreme.\\nIt’s also important to remember that there were many in the old Yugoslavia who had no\\ntruck with the inter-nation belligerence. Symbolically, a march in Sarajevo in March 1992\\nunited Bosnians, Serbs and Croats in opposing inter-ethnic conflict, but it ended \\nwhen\\nshots were fired from Serb positions, and Sarajevo’s first fatality was a student\\ndemonstrating for peace in that march. Such voices for peace were seldom heard.\\n \\nIt’s easy to see the Yugoslav civil wars of the 1990s as the build-up of inter-ethnic hatred\\nover many decades but that isn’t, on its own, a satisfying explanation. The ethnic and\\nreligious differences between most of the nations that made up Yugoslavia were, if\\nanything, much less pronounced than the differences among some of the German-\\nspeaking states that made up Germany from 1871 and continue to make up the country\\ntoday. Faced with joint threats in the 1920s and 1940s, the Yugoslav states were happy to\\ncome together, first as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, then as Yugoslavia\\nunder Tito, to fashion a state that defied international threats and did rather well out of both\\nMoscow and Washington. But once Tito had gone and Moscow’s influence was on the\\nwane, there was no longer an external threat to hold the various states together. And\\nperhaps the fact that they had been held together pretty much from 1918 to 1990 – largely\\nby Tito’s charisma and without the crimes of the civil war of 1941–45 being fully worked\\nthrough – meant conditions were rife for resentments to grow to the point where they\\ncreated a powder keg just waiting to be lit.\\nArguably the biggest tragedy is that Serb nationalism grew to the point where anyone\\nwho was not Serbian was relegated to second-class citizenship and ethnic cleansing was\\nconsidered (by some) a legitimate means of establishing the Serbian state. The idea that\\nSerbia had an ‘inclusive’ ideology in the 1850s and 1920s, viewing Croats, Montenegrins\\nand Macedonians as people who could live peacefully in the same country as Serbs, may\\nbe a little too benign as an interpretation of original Serb nationalism. The Nacertanije\\ndocument of 1844, which acted as a blueprint for the establishment of a sovereign Greater\\nSerbian state, talked of including Montenegro, Bosnia, \\nHerzegovina and northern Albania\\nin the new Serbia, and there are those who believe Serbian nationalists came to see the\\n1918 kingdom as a construct that they could dominate and, therefore, as a vehicle for\\nachieving Greater Serbia by the back door. But the fact that the Serbs worked moderately',\n",
       " 'successfully with their five fellow Yugoslav states up to 1990, plus the closeness of\\nSerbian language and culture to that of many of Serbia’s neighbours, suggests that an\\nentrenched ‘them and us’ attitude towards national identity is not helpful today. One hopes\\nthat Serbia’s application to join the European Union means ‘inclusiveness’ is back, if only\\nbecause Serbia’s economic well-being depends on it.\\nSo Serbia went into the 21st century restored as a sovereign state but needing to\\nundertake a massive exercise in rehabilitation. What Germany, Italy and Japan had faced\\nafter the Second World War, South Africa after apartheid, and Argentina after its era of\\nruthless military junta, Serbia faced after its bloody emergence from Yugoslavia. In this\\ncontext, if you had to draw up the ideal ambassador to represent the still-new Serbian state\\non the global stage, it would probably be a passionate Serb of mixed-nation parentage\\nwho both connects with his people and has the intellect and sensitivity to understand the\\nreservations harboured by an international community still in shock from the images of\\nSerbian brutality it saw on its television screens throughout the 1990s. How fortunate for\\nSerbia to have just the man.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER FIVE\\nTOUGHENED BY NATO’S BOMBS\\nI\\nt’s hard for a generation of people who have not known the hardship of war to hear the\\ntales of those who went through it. Those born in Europe after 1945 will have had to listen\\nto the stories of parents and grandparents telling them how they survived the fear and\\nprivations of the two world wars, the people they knew dying around them, the uncertainty\\nof not knowing who would be next – stories often told with a subliminal admonishing\\nmessage of ‘You don’t know how lucky you are’.\\nWhat distinguishes Novak Djokovic from Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray\\nand many of their contemporaries is that Djokovic does know. He was 11 when Nato\\nplanes started bombing Belgrade and he spent his 12th birthday with the bombing in full\\nswing. It didn’t stop him playing tennis, although each new day often meant a different\\ncourt. But spending many of the 76 nights of the bombing in a cellar robbed him of sleep,\\nas well as allowing him to share the collective fear of the whole city and, specifically, \\nthe\\npeople he and his brothers shared the cellar with. It’s he who will be boring his children\\nand grandchildren with tales of how he survived the war.\\nWhen the bombing began, the family was together in Belgrade after the winter season in\\nKopaonik. They spent much of the time in Grandfather Vlada’s two-bedroom flat, not\\nbecause it was a spacious place to be but because it had a basement storage area where\\nthe family could flee to whenever the sirens started.\\nIn late 2011 Djokovic allowed a camera team from the American television company\\nCBS to come with him and Vlada and visit the cellar where they spent many nights during\\nthe bombing, including every night of the first two weeks. Even today, the basement is\\nstark, lightless concrete. Modern warfare meant that, when the siren went, they had to go\\nstraight down to the cellar – there was no time to prepare as there had been during the\\nSecond World War – and there was no limit on the number of people allowed into the\\ncramped space. Watching him on camera in the cellar, it’s clear he has retained the child’s\\nability to be factual about it and not to impose on to his memory the feelings that come with\\nadult awareness. It’s just what happened, and if there’s any emotion attached to it, it’s the\\nschoolboy’s satisfaction of not having to go to school.\\nDjokovic was asked by the CBS interviewer Bob Simon whether he lost his focus. ‘The\\nfirst couple of weeks I did,’ he replied. ‘We were waking up every single night more or less\\nat two or three in the morning for two and a half months because of the bombing. But I try to\\nremember those days in a very bright, positive way. We didn’t need to go to school and I\\nplayed more tennis. It made us tougher, made us more hungry for success.’\\nHis coach Jelena Gencic, who had lived through the German and British bombings of\\nher country and had hoped never to experience another, tried to keep up his tennis\\neducation in spite of the carnage and chaos. Because she was a leading figure in the\\nSerbian tennis \\nworld, she could turn up at courts and they would let her play, so she was\\nconstantly looking for safe courts. ‘One morning I called him,’ she said, ‘and I said there’s a\\nmilitary hospital across the road from the tennis courts, so I said they probably wouldn’t\\nbomb the hospital, especially as all around it had been bombed. They went for a different\\nbombing target every night, so when a place was bombed, it seemed safe after that to\\npractise there. One day I made a mistake: they bombed the area where we had just been',\n",
       " 'playing. We changed clubs constantly. Once we thought of practising at a club on the other\\nside of the Danube but we didn’t because we thought the bridge might be bombed and we\\nwouldn’t get back. We were all very afraid and we had very little food, so we were hungry\\nand Novak often had to practise without having eaten enough.’\\nAna Ivanovic, a contemporary of Djokovic who had visited the Djokovic restaurant in\\nKopaonik when she was four (her father and Djokovic’s uncle Goran were at school\\ntogether), tells a similar story:\\nIt was a very tough period, not only for us as kids but for our country in general. The\\n1990s were very hard anyway, the economy wasn’t great and I remember the bombing\\nstarting on 24 March – it was actually my cousin’s birthday, so she was very sad\\nbecause she couldn’t celebrate it as everyone was going into the shelters. For the first\\nfew weeks we didn’t practise because we didn’t know what to expect, so we’d stay at\\nhome, but later on, when the danger was not there, when the sirens were off, that’s\\nwhen we started practising. Most of the time it was six to eight in the morning, or\\nmaybe seven to nine. We’d try to live as normal as possible. I remember towards the\\nend that they had an under-12s tournament and they even had a rule that, if the\\nmatches were on and the sirens came on, the match had to be finished but no new\\nmatches were called to start! I never played a match when the siren went off but I was\\nthere once when it went off.\\nIvanovic also tells the story of her and Djokovic having fun at tournaments around that time.\\n‘We shared lot of fun moments,’ she says. ‘We played lots of tournaments, under-10s,\\nunder-12s, in Serbia. We used to play hide and seek. You play two, three matches a day.\\nIn between you have nothing to do, so you play games.’ Without ever having been an item,\\nDjokovic and Ivanovic are very close – they are clearly very fond of each other and many\\nwho know them suggest Djokovic holds something of a candle for Ivanovic but not to an\\nextent that has ever threatened his relationship with his fiancée Jelena Ristic. It may be\\nmore of the shared history of both Kapaonik and surviving the bombing that creates a\\n‘bunker’ solidarity and thus transcends any conventional idea of friendship, sexual or\\notherwise.\\nThe Serbian coach and Davis Cup captain Bogdan Obradovic remembers that\\nlunchtimes, rather than early mornings, were the safest time to practise during the\\nbombing. He says he did most of his coaching between noon and 2 pm ‘because nothing\\nreally happened then’. The time is almost immaterial – the fact is they were constantly\\nadjusting their life and practice courts to keep clear of the best aircraft Nato had at its\\ndisposal.\\nThe impression someone from western Europe could get from such tales is that there\\nwas a string of tennis clubs dotted around Belgrade, but that would be a slightly misleading\\npicture. There were several courts but many of them were in a very modest state of repair.\\nTennis had never been particularly big in Yugoslavia and this was a time when the\\nSerbian economy was in a particularly parlous state. Often, it was a case of making a court\\nout of any available space. The most notorious example was the court at the Jedanaesti\\nApril club (the ‘11 April’ club) where Ivanovic and Janko Tipsarevic \\nplayed. The club had\\nan Olympic-sized swimming pool but it was too expensive to maintain, especially when\\npeople weren’t into swimming. So the pool was emptied, a carpet put in it and a singles\\ncourt was marked out – there wasn’t enough room for a doubles court. These days it’s a\\npool again and it has proper courts where Tipsarevic runs his academy. But that illustrates\\nthe lack of facilities available to budding tennis players in Serbia throughout the 1990s.',\n",

       " 'INTRODUCTION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nV\\nukovar, Srebrenica, Mostar, Banja Luka. Smallish towns in what was once Yugoslavia,\\nwhich became nightly recurring names on international television news bulletins in the\\n1990s. Equally recurring names were those of Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman, Alja\\nIzetbegovic, Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic – the leading protagonists from that same\\nconflict, the four wars that characterised the break-up of Yugoslavia. The reconstruction of\\nEurope after the Second World War based on economic interdependence was supposed\\nto prevent future wars in Europe. But 46 years after the end of the war and 34 years after\\nthe founding of what is today the European Union, neighbour turned against neighbour in\\nthe most appalling bloodbath, which a United Nations tribunal said included genocide. All\\non European soil.\\nIt’s tempting to see wars as neat packages of time – like the world stopped between\\n1914 and 1918, and stopped again from 1939 to 1945. It’s never like that. Life goes on,\\ndespite the fears and privations \\nof war. People learn to survive, they educate their kids,\\nand some of those kids can still learn to dance, or play a musical instrument or a sport the\\nway they would have done during peacetime.\\nAs such, it should surprise no one that out of the wreckage of war-torn Yugoslavia\\nshould come some gifted athletes. But that six world-class tennis players should come\\nfrom Serbia, a country of just 7.1 million inhabitants, 88,000 square kilometres and no real\\ntennis tradition, is something remarkable. And we are talking about six. Novak Djokovic,\\nAna Ivanovic, Jelena Jankovic and Nenad Zimonjic were all world-ranked No. 1 in the\\nspace of a few years: the first three in singles, Zimonjic in men’s doubles. Add to that\\nJanko Tipsarevic, who reached eighth and spent two years in the top 10, and Viktor\\nTroicki, who was once ranked 12th, and it is a remarkable generation, almost on a par with\\nthe Swedes, who defied their miniscule population to produce a phenomenal crop of tennis\\nplayers that dominated team tennis and many of the major titles from the mid-1970s to the\\nlate 1990s.\\nOf these six Serbs, Djokovic is by far the most successful. Ivanovic’s achievement of\\nwinning the 1998 French Open and reaching the top of the women’s rankings should not\\nbe underestimated but she held the top spot for only a few weeks and has never looked\\neven close to winning a second major since. She is a charming and stunningly good-\\nlooking ambassador for her country but her results limit how effective she can be. Jankovic\\nis one of only three women players to have topped the rankings without having won a\\nGrand Slam singles title – her achievement speaks for her phenomenal consistency in\\n2008–9, but she too has looked a long way from taking herself off that list in the intervening\\nyears.\\nBy contrast, Djokovic has notched up six Grand Slam titles and needs only the French\\nOpen to complete a career Grand Slam. More importantly, he has shown he is the equal of\\nRoger Federer and Rafael Nadal in having the charisma and gravitas to represent his\\nsport, and has set an example by his dignified and gracious behaviour. And that is of\\nmassive importance to his country. His career is moderately well documented and his\\nnatural charisma is enhanced by one or two of his sideshows – his impersonations of\\nfellow professionals, his habit of calling the trainer during matches (now largely extinct)\\nand his voluble father. But no one has yet set it against the background of his country’s\\nemergence from the horrors of the 1990s bloodshed. This book is an attempt to do that.',\n",
       " ' \\nIt would be tempting – though not entirely true – to say the seed for this book was sown in\\nSeptember 2010.\\nI was in Belgrade for the first time, covering the Davis Cup semi-final between Serbia\\nand the Czech Republic. I arrived on the Wednesday evening, and when I hooked up with\\nthe people I was working with, found that they’d arranged to eat at Novak’s, one of the two\\nrestaurants in Belgrade owned by Novak Djokovic. How appropriate – my first ever meal in\\nBelgrade at the restaurant of the man who was putting Serbia on the map! And just one\\nblock from the Beogradska Arena, the 17,000-seater indoor stadium that had become the\\nspiritual home of Serbian tennis.\\nThe following morning I had to interview Djokovic for television, and while we were\\nwaiting for the cameraman to get set up, I told him that I’d eaten at his restaurant the night\\nbefore. He asked me what I thought of it. I hesitated, trying to think of the politest way to say\\nthat the food was very good (it was) but it was rather a long time coming (I’ve since learned\\nthat you do wait a long time for your food in Serbian restaurants and Novak’s isn’t\\nparticularly slow). But I never got to say that because Djokovic interjected with ‘Don’t tell\\nme – it was too smoky, wasn’t it?’ I had to admit it was, to which he added, ‘Yes, we’re\\ngetting there but it’s slow and we’ve a long way to go.’\\nWhat struck me about his response was that it encapsulated the \\ndual role Djokovic\\nplays. He’s totally comfortable outside Serbia, fully integrated into the western European\\nand North American culture where smoking in public places is now unacceptable\\n(normally banned), where all good restaurants offer healthy options and where patriotism is\\nwelcomed but nationalism is viewed with suspicion, especially when it gets vociferous. Yet\\nhe’s also totally comfortable in his own country, even though he acts with a slightly\\ndifferent register – he’s a bit more jingoistic, happy to join in with Serbian songs and\\ncultural rituals, even a bit of blatant nationalism. That, at least, is my impression. He\\nhimself denies it, saying he always acts the same: ‘I always try to be respectful and kind to\\neveryone no matter what country they come from, or where I am on the map. That applies\\nto my compatriots, too.’ That may indeed be his intention, though I stand by my sense that\\nthere are subtle changes he makes when he’s in his homeland.\\nThat brief exchange wasn’t the genesis of this book but it played an important role when\\nJohn Blake Publishing came to me in 2012 and asked if I would write a biography of\\nDjokovic. My first step was to approach Djokovic’s agent and see if an authorised\\nbiography or ghosted autobiography might be on the cards. I was told that neither was an\\noption, as Djokovic wants to write his own book when his playing career ends. That left me\\nwith the option of an independent biography of Djokovic, or nothing. As I had written Roger\\nFederer’s biography on that basis and updated it several times, I had no particular desire to\\nwrite another straight tennis biography, so I told Blake I wasn’t up for the Djokovic book.\\nBlake’s staff came back saying they were particularly keen to have a book about\\nDjokovic, so would I reconsider? I thought about it and kept being struck by my realisation\\nabout how Djokovic spans these two cultures: the Serbian and the international. I’ve also\\nbeen struck by how little the western world understands about Serbia, so I went back to\\nBlake and offered them a book that was a mixture \\nof Djokovic’s own story and Serbia’s\\nstory. They jumped at the suggestion and this is that book.\\n \\nFor a book like this to work, the author needs a bit of good fortune and I had two distinct\\nstrokes of luck.\\nThe first came when I got an email from Chris Bowers. If this sounds like a bad case of',\n",
       " 'talking to myself, it isn’t. I have a namesake who used to work at the BBC at the same time\\nas I did and he contacted me confessing to a 20-year guilty conscience about having\\naccepted a dinner date from a female admirer who, it transpired, had heard my voice on the\\nradio, not his. I found that touching – and, no doubt, a little flattering – but more significant\\nwas his email address. I recognised that he worked for the British foreign ministry and,\\nthrough him, I was able to re-establish contact with a colleague of his and an old tennis-\\nplaying friend of mine, Mike Davenport. And Mike just happened to be the newly minted\\nBritish ambassador to Belgrade, who subsequently proved of immense help to me in\\nresearching this book. I therefore gladly accept Chris’s confession.\\nThe second came when the most important interview for this book not only materialised\\nbut provided me with one of the most uplifting moments of my journalistic career.\\nI had identified early in my preparation that the most important person I needed to talk to\\nwas Jelena Gencic, the woman who taught Novak to play tennis. In March 2013 I went to\\nBelgrade on a bit of a flyer – I had a trip planned for the following month but wanted to\\nmake sure I actually had some interviews arranged, so decided it would be best to make\\nan exploratory advance trip. It was on that exploratory trip that Gencic was not only\\navailable but gave me two and a half hours of her time in her favourite watering hole, the\\nCafé Ozon in the Dedinje suburb of Belgrade. The question about \\nDesert Island Discs\\n (see\\npage 41) came fairly early,\\nand when she listed ‘Mahler’s Adagio’, I interrupted her and said, ‘Do you mean the\\nAdagietto from Mahler’s Fifth Symphony?’ Her eyes lit up. ‘Ah, you know it,’ she said and\\nfrom then on the connection between us was a wonderful one. As I left the café, I felt\\nmoved to hug her, even though I’d known her for barely two hours.\\nThe following day I was mulling over what she’d told me and was beginning to see the\\nchapter ‘Nole and Jeca’ that appears in this book. It all seemed too good to be true. Gencic\\nhad reminded me of my own grandmother, a great story teller but something of a\\nMärchentante\\n, a German word for a teller of stories that often improve with the telling. So I\\nasked my contact who had introduced me to Gencic whether I could trust what Jelena had\\ntold me. She seemed puzzled at my question. I explained that it seemed almost like a fairy\\ntale – the cultured woman from the affluent Yugoslav intelligentsia finding she had a total\\nmeeting of minds with this boy from a moderately simple family, and taught him a lot more\\nthan just forehands and backhands – and I wanted to be sure it wasn’t all a massive tale\\ntold to impress the journalist from abroad. My contact, who knew Gencic fairly well,\\nassured me that she was not the kind of woman to embellish stories, at least not more than\\nin a very minor way, and she always stuck to what she believed was the truth.\\nWhen I went back to Belgrade the following month, Jelena and her sister welcomed me\\nto their home. I wish I had enjoyed the Turkish coffee they gave me – I confess I found it\\nutterly disgusting but I very much appreciated the hospitality. I admired her trophies, asked\\nher a few more questions and checked a few details from my interview a few weeks earlier.\\nAs I left, she promised to check anything else I wasn’t sure about if I’d just email it to her. I\\nnever saw her again.\\nJelena Gencic died on 1 June 2013. Unbeknown to me, she had been fighting breast\\ncancer for some time, but it wasn’t that that killed her. Most people close to her knew she\\nhad breast cancer and \\nshe had largely beaten it. But few knew that she also had liver\\ncancer, and that finished her. I saw her five weeks before she died. She was spending 7–\\n10 hours a day on the tennis court, not running around but doing lots of coaching. She\\nlooked like she could have planned her 90th birthday party but at 76 her life came to an\\nabrupt end.',\n",
       " 'I was told about her death by text message. I was at Roland Garros and the message\\ncame with the strict instruction that I was to say nothing to anyone close to Djokovic until\\nhe had gone on court for his third-round match against Grigor Dimitrov. That was wise\\nadvice, for when Djokovic came off court, he was given the news, burst into tears and\\npromptly cancelled all media obligations because he was so upset. After his fourth-round\\nwin, he was happy to talk about her and his 10-minute English press conference was\\nalmost exclusively about Gencic. I remember that Saturday night for the strange emotion of\\ngrieving for someone I’d met just twice and hardly knew but who I felt I knew very well. I\\nwas also the last journalist to do a formal interview with her, so was consumed by the\\nuncomfortable mix of relief and elation of having got her to talk before she left us, and\\nterrible sadness that she should die with so much vitality apparently still left in her.\\nAs such, in the months since her death I have mulled over whether I have become too\\nemotional in the section about her. And whether I have afforded her an importance in the\\nDjokovic story that goes beyond what she warrants. I don’t think I have. Djokovic himself\\ntalks about destiny, and while he’s likely to have made it to the top in tennis even without\\nGencic’s input, I remain convinced that he would not be the person he is today without her\\ninfluence and his route to the top would not have been as painless. After all, he does have\\na number of health issues that he has had to overcome through a lot of trial and error –\\nwould he have been open to the holistic approach of an Igor Cetojevic (see pages 174–6)\\nif he had \\nnot been exposed to Gencic’s open-mindedness at an early age? And would he,\\nwithout Gencic, have developed the sense of statesmanship that allows him to straddle the\\ntwo worlds of his fiercely patriotic Serbia and a global community that has grown to like\\nhim but still mistrusts the country he hails from? It would be wrong to overplay Gencic’s\\nrole in Djokovic’s tennis development – she never travelled with him and he did have four\\nyears in his early adulthood when he wasn’t even in contact with her – but I am convinced\\nshe deserves a chapter of her own.\\n \\nA classic question people ask when they see a biography is whether it is ‘authorised’ or\\nnot. I dislike the term ‘authorised’, as it implies something official, with the content\\ncontrolled by the subject. I have no desire to write a book about Novak Djokovic that is\\ncontrolled by him – he is intelligent enough to write his own book if he wishes, in which he\\ncan say what he likes (as he is highly likely to do at some stage). That will have validity as\\nhis take on his career with the inside story on certain events, but it will only be his side of\\nthe story. This book has many people’s input on his life and career (so far).\\nThis, therefore, is an \\nindependent\\n biography, both of Djokovic and of Serbia. It is my take\\non him and his country. People can disagree with what I say and some of it is opinion\\nrather than peer-reviewed research. In terms of his own approach to it, because he wants\\nto write his own book when he retires, he wasn’t keen for his closest family to talk to me –\\nsomething I have respected. Those who are part of his team are bound by a confidentiality\\nagreement but many people who are close to him have been willing to talk to me, for which\\nI sincerely thank them. And Djokovic himself has helped me by answering a number of\\nquestions I put to him about his role as a sporting statesman.\\nIt’s important to make this clear because Djokovic is a superstar. \\n‘Do you realise just\\nhow much the country stops when he plays?’ asked Guy De Launey, the BBC’s Belgrade\\ncorrespondent, when I met him to get his views for some of the chapters on Serbia. And\\nDjokovic’s friend Dusan Vemic says, ‘If Novak is playing some big matches during the\\nGrand Slam season, the streets are empty. Everyone is at home cheering for him.’ He has\\ntherefore attained the status of something approaching a secular saint in Serbia, much of it',\n",
       " 'deserved, but it is still important to look at him dispassionately. This is why I have been\\ncritical of him at certain points in this book – not out of malice but simply because he is a\\nhuman being made of flesh and blood, and in our celebrity-dominated era, it’s important to\\nbe able to see that even the people we most admire are packages of good and not-so-\\ngood attributes.\\n \\nA word about accents. A number of accents are used in central and eastern European\\northography, many of them reflecting the transfer of Slav names from the Cyrillic to the\\nRoman alphabet. I had to make a decision whether to use accents or not and, realistically,\\nit was all or nothing. My instinct as someone who has learned three languages beyond my\\nmother tongue was to put the accents in, but in the end, I opted not to. The main reason for\\nthis is that the name ‘Djokovic’ is a westernisation of how his name is written at home. The\\nRoman alphabet version is ‘Ðoković’, with the j added in typefaces where the line through\\nthe D is not available (like the way an e is added in German when the \\nUmlaut\\n is not\\navailable, so ‘Schüttler’ becomes ‘Schuettler’, ‘Görges’ becomes ‘Goerges’, etc.). Given\\nthat Novak is known across the English-speaking world as ‘Djokovic’, it would have gone\\nagainst the grain to call him ‘Ðjoković’ throughout this book and the logical extension was\\nto exclude all accents. I beg forgiveness from fellow-linguists who feel that judgement was\\nwrong.\\nAnd while we’re on the name, let me try and lay to rest the \\nindefatigable question of how\\nyou pronounce the first vowel in ‘Djokovic’. The Americans have pushed the line that it\\nshould be pronounced as in the word ‘joke’, while the rest of the world has tended to say\\n‘jock’. The idea of ‘joke’ comes from a belief that the best thing you can do is to copy the\\nway the person says his own name. Indeed, this continued even into the 2013 Australian\\nOpen when Jim Courier used a question in a post-match on-court interview to try and get\\nDjokovic to give him the definitive pronunciation of the troublesome vowel.\\nThe sentiment of asking the person concerned how he (or she) pronounces their name is\\na nice one but it misses a very simple relevant fact: how they pronounce other words with\\nthe same vowel. If you listen to the way Djokovic says words like ‘on’ and ‘over’, it’s clear\\nhis (and other Serbs’) pronunciation of his surname is the same vowel as ‘on’, not ‘over’.\\nThat means the pronunciation based on ‘jock’ is the correct one and ought to come as a\\nrelief to the entire English-speaking world, as the strictly accurate pronunciation is more\\nlike ‘or’ (so ‘Djorkovic’) than ‘jock’ or ‘joke’. Where the Americans can claim some\\njustification is that the vowel sound in ‘Novak’ is pretty much the same as in ‘Djokovic’, so\\nreally the English-speaking world should be saying ‘Novak’ as in ‘of’ and ‘Djokovic’ as in\\n‘jock’. But no doubt the debate will rage as long as he’s playing, so radio and television\\npronunciation units can continue to justify their existence.\\n \\nFinally, I couldn’t have produced this book without the help of lots of people. I list them\\nhere in alphabetical order with more thanks than I can convey and a fear that I have left\\none or two out: Edoardo Artaldi, Simon Cambers, Igor Cetojevic, Estelle Couderc, Michael\\nDavenport, Guy De Launey, Jelena Gencic, Mitzi Ingram-Evans, Goran Ivanisevic, Ana\\nIvanovic, Momir Jelovac, Cathy Jenkins, Jonathan Jobson, Ladislav Kis, Angela Lavinski,\\nDavid \\nLaw, Ivan Ljubicic, Stevan Lukic, Janice McKinlay, Neda Miletic, Helen McCarthy,\\nJoanna Mather, Peter Miles, Stuart Miller, Zoran Milosavljevic, Ana Mitric, Vladimir Novak,\\nBogdan Obradovic, Dejan Petrovic, Riccardo Piatti, Nikki Pilic, Monica Seles, Greg\\nSharko, Cedomir Soskic, Toplica Spasojevic, Vojin Velickovic, Gavin Versi, Nebojsa\\nViskovic and Jonathan Wilson.

       " 'CHAPTER ONE\\nAN ETHNIC MIX\\nT\\nhe philosopher and travel writer Hermann Keyserling once wrote, ‘I am not a Dane, not a\\nGerman, not a Swede, not a Russian nor an Estonian, so what am I? – a little of all these.’\\nThus, in an era where transport allows for inter-nation marriages as a matter of course, no\\none should be too surprised to find that Serbia’s leading global flag-carrier, Novak\\nDjokovic, should be a real ethnic mix. At least he was born in Serbia – unlike India’s\\nspiritual leader Mahatma Gandhi, who was born in South Africa, or America’s most\\npatriotic Davis Cup player John McEnroe, who was born in Germany. But from his ethnic\\nheritage you could argue he was half-Montenegrin and half-Croat.\\nDoes this matter? Hardly at all. As Djokovic’s close friend Ivan Ljubicic says, ‘You can\\nbe patriotic without being nationalistic.’ And Ljubicic should know – born in the Bosnian\\ntown of Banja Luka to a Bosnian Muslim mother and a Croatian Catholic father, he barely\\npassed through Croatia en route to the relative safety of Italy during the Yugoslav wars of\\nthe 1990s, yet became Croatia’s \\nnational hero when he steered the still-young republic to\\nthe Davis Cup title in 2005 with a record-breaking 11 straight wins in live matches. In the\\nBalkans there are thousands of people who are the products of inter-nation marriages. In\\nfact, having links to Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Croatia probably broadens\\nDjokovic’s Balkan fan base.\\nTracing the Djokovic family tree back, the records are sketchy but the first obvious\\nancestor is Djoko Damjanovic, who appears to have established the Djokovic surname\\naround 1730. The suffix ‘-vic’ means ‘son of’, like ‘-son’ in England, ‘Mc/Mac’ in Scotland,\\n‘’O’ in Ireland, etc. So Djoko Damjanovic’s children had the surname Djokovic, after which\\nthe same surname was passed through male descendants. Damjanovic set up home in\\nJasenovo Polje, a village whose name means ‘ash fields’ near the Montenegrin town of\\nNiksic. In 1928 the head of the family, Nedeljko Djokovic, moved east from Montenegro to\\na village called Vocnjak in Metohija, part of the province of Kosovo, which at that time was\\npart of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia. In 1951 Nedeljko’s son Vladimir, Novak’s\\ngrandfather, moved to Mitrovica, the main ethnic Serbian town in Kosovo. In 1961 his son\\nSrdjan was born and in 1964 he had a second son, Goran.\\nThere had been one Novak Djokovic in the family. He grew up in Jasenovo Polje before\\nemigrating to Chicago in 1905 but returned to fight for his country. Apparently, when filling\\nin his immigration form as his ship docked in the USA, under ‘Nationality (country of which\\ncitizen or subject)’ he wrote ‘Montenegro’ and under ‘Race of people’ ‘Montenegrin’.\\nMontenegro at that time was already recognised as a sovereign state, having come to a\\nform of independence in 1878 under the same settlement that saw Serbia become\\nindependent from the Ottoman Empire.\\nIn 1986 Srdjan married Dijana Zagar. She was born in Belgrade in January 1964, the\\ndaughter of two military personnel. Her father \\nZdenka was a high-ranking officer in the\\nYugoslav National Army and a pharmacist, who became purchasing manager for a military\\nhospital. Her mother Elizabete was a major in the army and a chief medical officer in the\\nmilitary hospital (Dijana’s sister is a pharmacist as well). They were originally from\\nVinkovici, a town in the eastern part of Croatia near the Serbian border, and they moved to\\nBelgrade before Dijana’s birth when Zdenka was transferred by the army to the military',\n",
       " 'hospital in what was then the Yugoslav capital. Not surprisingly, Djokovic has lots of\\nrelatives in and around Vinkovici.\\nVery little is known about either family. The few interviews that Srdjan gives are\\ngenerally about his son or Serbian tennis politics, while Dijana gives virtually no\\ninterviews. The Serbian tennis writer Vojin Velickovic says, ‘Because Srdjan is so volatile,\\nwe never asked him too much because we didn’t want to go too far, and I don’t need that\\nkind of information for my tennis reports.’ Some reports say Srdjan was at one stage a\\nfootballer on the books of Mitrovica’s main club FC Trepca, while the fact that he and\\nDijana gave skiing lessons leads to the assumption that they were gifted skiers. ‘Maybe\\nSrdjan was a football player,’ Velickovic says, ‘but no one remembers. If he did play, it\\nwould be at a very low level. We assume he was a good skier but that’s also a grey area.’\\nDijana’s family is known to have a fair bit of volleyball talent but she didn’t play much.\\nVelickovic adds, ‘A friend of hers told me she was a very gifted gymnast. Obviously Novak\\nis very flexible, so when I spoke to him once, I told him that I’d heard he’d inherited his\\ngenes from his mother, not his father, because he was so flexible. And he joked, “Yes, I’m\\na champion because of my mother, not my father.” But she never wanted to give an\\ninterview to the media, maybe because she doesn’t want to be in the spotlight.’\\nOne person who got some insight into the Djokovic family home was Djokovic’s first\\ncoach, Jelena Gencic. She got to know the \\nfamily when Novak was five, which was about\\nthe time his paternal grandmother died. She recalled, ‘Srdjan’s father Vladimir, known as\\nGrandfather Vlada, was a very good man. He was a man of great warmth who made you\\nfeel nice. His wife died the year I started working with Novak, so I didn’t know her but\\neveryone says she was an excellent woman, such a humanitarian, so unbelievable –\\nmaybe Novak has his humanity from her? It was a very patriarchal family. The grandfather\\nwas the patriarch. We couldn’t start eating until the patriarch had sat down and started to\\neat. And we couldn’t get up until he had given his approval. So Novak had a very good\\nfamily education. The family wasn’t primitive but only ever had just enough.’\\nOn 22 May 1987 Srdjan and Dijana celebrated the birth of their first son, Novak, in\\nBelgrade. It was just four days after Srdjan’s 26th birthday. At that stage they were\\nrestaurateurs in Belgrade. Two years later, with the political and economic situation in\\nYugoslavia starting to look very precarious, they and Srdjan’s brother Goran opened up a\\nsecond restaurant, a pizzeria which also sold pancakes, and a boutique in Kopaonik, a\\nmountain resort on the boundary where Kosovo started, about 50km (as the crow flies)\\nfrom Mitrovica. They didn’t spend all year there – only the peak skiing season in winter and\\nthe hiking season in summer. In winter they had the punishing regime of giving skiing\\nlessons by day and working in the restaurant at night. The rest of the time they lived in\\nBelgrade.\\nIn August 1991 Marko Djokovic was born, and a third son, Djordje, was born in July\\n1995. Once Novak began going to school, it meant that during the skiing and hiking\\nseasons he often had to stay in the Belgrade flat of the newly widowed Grandfather Vlada,\\nsometimes for several weeks at a stretch. He was later to seek refuge from the 1999 Nato\\nbombing of Belgrade in the basement store of that flat. When Vlada died in April 2012\\nduring the Monte Carlo Masters, the media remarked that Djokovic didn’t seem quite the\\nsame and in fact did very well to reach the final where he lost to Rafael Nadal. The death\\nof a grandparent affects everyone differently but this was no ordinary grandparent – Vlada\\nwas a parental substitute who was a massive figure in Djokovic’s life.\\nThis dual existence of the urban landscape of Belgrade and the rural, mountainous\\nlandscape of Kopaonik not only shaped Djokovic but gave him a heightened sense of his',\n",

Each\\nstone, mountain, city, village has some powerful story to it, that I am very proud of. That’s\\nwhy we Serbs have very strong sense of belongingness, because of our history.\\nEverybody has heard of Belgrade, but my country has so many beautiful cities and villages\\nthat people should come and see. So many legends they can hear about my people, kings\\nand queens… I honestly think that the soul of my country lies within villages in the south.\\nKosovo is a cradle of Serbian history. It has over 2,000 monasteries and churches that\\nsymbolise our culture and the beginnings of the Serbian Orthodox religion. Belgrade is a\\nmodern metropolis, it can give you everything, but the true Serbia is in the south. I\\nremember myself as a kid spending a lot of time on Kopaonik and admiring every time the\\nview of Serbia I had from this beautiful and powerful mountain.’\\nLike any boy of five, young Novak enjoyed kicking a football and was taught to ski from a\\nvery early age. There was no history of tennis in the family – Srjdan and Dijana could\\nprobably have told you very little about it when one day their elder son caught sight of\\ntennis on the television. It ignited a spark in him that led him, a few weeks later, to\\napproach the woman who would set him on the road to being the best in the world.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER TWO\\nWHO ARE THE SERBS?\\nT\\no all but the keenest historians or current-affairs aficionados, the term ‘Serbia’ probably\\ndoesn’t mean a great deal – in fact, to many, the first image the term conjures up is\\nprobably that of Novak Djokovic, even to those who don’t call themselves tennis fans.\\nSome who have vague recollections of their history lessons at school may remember that\\nSerbia had something to do with the outbreak of the First World War, and those watching\\nthe news in the 1990s will have heard the name Serbia on many occasions, often in\\nconnection with the word ‘atrocities’. But even those who were regular news followers in\\nthe 1960s, 1970s and 1980s can be forgiven for not knowing where or what Serbia was.\\nThe reason for this is that, while the Serbs have existed in the south-eastern corner of\\nEurope known as the Balkans since the sixth century, for most of that time they have not\\nbeen a country in their own right. In fact, Serbia on its own has only been a sovereign state\\nthree times: from 1166 to 1459, from 1878 to 1918 \\nand from 2006 to the present. The\\nSerbs, therefore, are by no means a new people but they are a new country, hence the\\nscope for a dominant world sportsman to become a statesman and standard-bearer for his\\ncountry. (Technically, the term ‘Serb’ denotes an ethnic Serb, while a ‘Serbian’ is a citizen\\nof Serbia, so the difference can be important.)\\nThe Serbs are one of the Slav peoples. Because the Slavs are the fourth biggest ethno-\\nlinguistic grouping in the world, it’s hard to give a precise definition of Slavs but they are an\\nIndo-European race who are generally divided into three groups: the eastern Slavs\\npopulating today’s Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, plus parts of central Asia and Siberia; the\\ncentral Slavs populating countries and areas such as Poland, the Czech Republic,\\nSlovakia and Silesia; and the southern Slavs, of which the Serbs are the biggest group,\\nalong with the Croats, Montenegrins, Bulgarians and Macedonians (but not Slovenes or\\nAlbanians). The southern Slavs are largely Christian, though with various differences. For\\nexample, the Serbs are largely Orthodox Christian, while the Croats are Roman Catholic.\\nFor much of the 14th century Serbia was the most powerful state in the Balkans, but it\\nwas defeated in the battle of Kosovo Field in 1389, marking the end of its pre-eminence.\\nAfter the battle of Smederovo in 1459, the independent kingdom of Serbia was subsumed\\ninto the Ottoman Empire, the Turkish empire ruled from the ancient city of Constantinople\\n(now Istanbul). The 1389 defeat in Kosovo became a scar on Serbian national\\nconsciousness, which lingered into the 20th century, as the province of Kosovo became of\\npsychological importance to Serbia, even though by the late 20th century it was populated\\nlargely by ethnic Albanians. It has some relevance to the Djokovic story: Djokovic’s father\\nand grandfather were from Kosovo, the ski resort of Kopaonik where Novak first learned to\\nplay tennis is right on the border between the undisputed \\nSerbian territory and Kosovo,\\nand Djokovic had to shelter from the 1999 Nato bombing raids on Belgrade that resulted\\nfrom the ethnic Serb-Albanian conflict in Kosovo.\\nUntil 1918 most of the southern Slav peoples were under the control of larger empires,\\ngenerally either the Ottoman Empire or the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But long before the\\nFirst World War those empires were decaying. The Ottomans’ heyday had been in the 16th\\nand 17th centuries; by 1850 the empire was becoming harder to hold together, while\\nAustria-Hungary was ruled by the Habsburg royal family of Vienna, who were increasingly',\n",
       " 'fighting domestic battles closer to home as nationalist fervour grew in states that are\\ntoday’s Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.\\nSome suggestions had been mooted in the middle of the 19th century that the southern\\nSlavs might join forces in a united country but the largest of them also had their eye on\\nbecoming nation states of their own. Serbia and Montenegro were the first of them to break\\nfree from Ottoman control, becoming countries in their own right in 1878 following the\\nRusso-Turkish war. Russia’s foreign policy at that time was geared towards trying to get\\naccess to the Mediterranean Sea and, to this end, it developed friendly relations with\\nSerbia, a fellow Slav nation. Out of that grew Serbia’s military and diplomatic alliance with\\nRussia, which played a part in the outbreak of the First World War. The traditional\\ninterpretation has been that, when a Serb radical, Gavrilo Princip, shot dead the heir to the\\nAustro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo in June 1914, it\\ntriggered the diplomatic tit-for-tat and mobilisation of forces that led to the outbreak of war\\nfive weeks later: Austria declared war on Serbia to avenge the killing, Russia was\\ncompelled to come to Serbia’s aid, Germany came to Austria’s aid and the whole thing\\nbecame the world’s first global conflict. Recently it has been suggested that this is too\\nsimple – that Germany was dead-set on going to war and was looking for an \\nexcuse to\\ndeclare war on Serbia. Whatever the ultimate motivation, by the summer of 1914 Europe\\nwas like a tinder-dry forest just waiting for a spark to set the whole continent alight, and the\\nSarajevo assassination was the spark that started what became known as ‘the Great War’.\\nWith the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires effectively crushed during the war,\\n1918 was the obvious time for new nations to emerge in south-eastern Europe. But the\\nlegacy of being ruled by a large empire, allied to fears that Italy might try to sweep up a lot\\nof territory along the Adriatic coast, led to the formation of a country made up initially of\\nseveral southern Slav peoples. It was called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\\nbut it also included Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia-Slavonia, a semi-\\nautonomous region of Hungary, and Dalmatia (Monica Seles, Yugoslavia’s most\\nsuccessful tennis player, was ethnically a Hungarian who came from Novi Sad in the\\nSerbian province of Vojvodina). The new kingdom was proclaimed in December 1918 and\\nruled by the Serbian royal family, initially under King Peter I. For many Serbs, the kingdom\\nwas a continuation of the Serbian sovereignty that had existed since 1878, and certainly it\\namounted to a form of self-determination compared with being under Turkish or Austrian\\nrule. But it’s perhaps easier for the Serbs to feel this way, as they were the dominant nation\\nin the new kingdom, whereas Croats, Slovenes and other nations find it harder to see this\\nas full independence, at least compared to the independence and sovereignty they have\\nenjoyed since the early 1990s.\\nReligiously, the Serbs are Orthodox Christian while the Croats are Roman Catholic, but\\nthe Serb language is very close to Croatian (almost as close as British English and\\nAmerican English are to each other), and Macedonian and Slovenian are also related to\\nSerbian and Croatian. Given that there had been lots of migration and intermarriage\\namong the southern Slav peoples, the new kingdom \\nought to have worked. After all, in\\n1871 22 German-speaking kingdoms, principalities and duchies had come together to form\\na new country called Germany, and while it had led itself – and the world – into a\\ndisastrous war, it had worked as a country and was still intact. The ethnic, linguistic and\\ncultural differences between the Serbs and Croats are not as pronounced as those\\nbetween the Prussians and Bavarians, so the new southern Slav country had every\\nchance of succeeding.\\nOr so went the theory. In practice, the nationalism that had been growing for the previous',\n",
       " '70 years continued, only now it was directed against the new kingdom based in Belgrade,\\nrather than against the archaic rulers in Constantinople or Vienna. The first result was a\\nstrengthening of state powers in 1929, making the kingdom effectively a dictatorship. The\\noutward sign of that was a change of name – as the kingdom was an alliance of southern\\nSlav peoples, it adopted the name Yugoslavia, from the Slav words ‘jugo’ (of the south)\\nand ‘slavija’ (Slavs).\\nYugoslavia survived the assassination of its tennis-loving king, Alexander I, in 1934 – he\\nwas shot dead by a Macedonian working with Croatian separatists – but it didn’t survive\\nthe outbreak of the Second World War. In 1941 it was taken over by the Axis powers\\n(Germany and Italy), who set up a particularly nasty Croatian-led fascist government, the\\nUstase. The Ustase set about liquidating Jews and gipsies, and relegating Serbs to\\nsomewhere well below the status of second-class citizens.\\nIt was, in effect, ethnic cleansing, a term that only came into widespread use in the\\n1990s. When people talk about the Yugoslav civil war, they generally refer to the battles of\\nthe 1990s that led to the break-up of Yugoslavia and the establishment of new sovereign\\nstates, but the period 1941–45 saw an equally brutal civil war which left unresolved many\\nof the resentments that flared up again in the 1990s. The Ustase’s brutality (even some\\nmembers of the Nazi high \\ncommand in Berlin felt their acolytes in Zagreb were going too\\nfar) led to resistance from the Cetniks, a pro-monarchist Serbian movement, and from the\\nPartisans, a communist movement led by a former Russian revolutionary, Josip Broz Tito.\\nSo while the Second World War raged to the north, the Ustase, Cetniks and Partisans\\nfought out the bloody civil war for the remains of Yugoslavia.\\nIn short, Tito and his Partisans won that civil war and set up a new Yugoslav republic\\ntaking in six federated states: Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro\\nand Macedonia. The Yugoslav capital was the Serbian capital, Belgrade. Tito’s pitch was\\na communist one (in the sense of a state-controlled economy working in the interests of the\\nworking class), with the slogan ‘brotherhood and unity’. He also had immense personal\\ncharisma, plus a transnational profile based on having a Croatian father, a Slovenian\\nmother, and operating from Serbia’s principal city. Having gained material support from the\\nAllied powers (Great Britain, the USA and the USSR), he was seen by many of his\\ncompatriots as the man who had liberated Yugoslavia, so he was a popular leader after\\n1945.\\nTito ruled Yugoslavia for the next 35 years. Originally a supporter of Stalin’s communist\\nstate in Russia, he broke from Moscow in 1948, pursuing his own form of communism\\nindependently of the USSR’s influence. During the Cold War, Tito and Yugoslavia gained\\na respected global position as one of the leading players in the Non-Aligned Movement, a\\nloose association of largish countries who refused to ally themselves with either the USA\\nor the USSR. He also oversaw an economic boom in the 1950s and 1960s, and allowed\\nYugoslav citizens to travel abroad for work and pleasure, something other countries in the\\nSoviet bloc did not permit.\\nThe West loved Yugoslavia. As western nations battled with the threat posed by the\\nSoviet Empire run from Moscow, they enjoyed \\nhaving a communist state in eastern Europe\\nthat was not under Moscow’s thumb. But as Tito aged, so the fears grew about whether it\\nwas only he who could hold together the six disparate states, and many asked what would\\nhappen when he died. Some were unworried, saying the governing structure of Yugoslavia\\nwould survive the demise of one man, or another leader would emerge, while others feared\\nthe worst. Both were proved right, after a fashion.\\nTito died in 1980 and for a while Yugoslavia carried on as normal. But the nationalist',\n",
       " 'passions that Tito had held under control (at times by raw oppression – his regime has\\nbeen described by some as ‘an iron fist in a velvet glove’) gained in confidence and, as the\\nconcept of communism fell into disrepute across eastern Europe in the late 1980s, the\\nnationalism of the six Yugoslav states grew and grew.\\nThose who had hoped a dominant figure might emerge to assume Tito’s role thought\\nthey might have found their man when Slobodan Milosevic became the president of\\nSerbia. He was certainly a very charismatic and ambitious leader, who wanted to preside\\nover the whole of Yugoslavia. But Tito was a war hero who had the mixed Croat-Slovene\\nparentage and was at home in Belgrade, whereas Milosevic was Serb through and\\nthrough. And while his oratory might have roused the Serbs, it was anathema to the other\\npeoples of Yugoslavia, so he was never going to become a leader in the Tito mould.\\nOnce he realised that Serbia was never going to take over the whole of Yugoslavia,\\nMilosevic embarked on a policy that effectively laid the foundations for the wars that broke\\nup the federation. He was relatively happy for peoples that formed different nations to\\nsecede from Yugoslavia, as long as they didn’t take any predominantly Serb areas with\\nthem. So, for example, he was content for Slovenia to go, as there were very few Serbs\\nthere, and he was also willing for Croatia to have independence, as long as it \\ndidn’t take\\nthe mainly Serb region of Krajina with it. Yet Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, Montengrins,\\nMacedonians, Albanians and others had migrated and intermarried within the southern\\nSlav states for decades (including Novak Djokovic’s Kosovan Serb/ Montenegrin father\\nand Croatian mother), so such a clean division into ethnically defined states was always\\ngoing to create massive problems.\\nWhen Milosevic met with the emerging Croatian leader Franjo Tudjman, a veteran of the\\nbloody civil war of 1941–45, to agree the ethnic divide of Bosnia in March 1990, so\\nBosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats could be part of the emerging Serbia and Croatia, they\\nwere effectively setting out the conditions for war. That war broke out the following year\\nwith appalling consequences.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER THREE\\nNOLE AND JECA\\nT\\nhere used to be a saying: Behind every successful man is a powerful woman. The\\ndictum has somewhat fallen victim to changing social circumstances – marriage break-up,\\nsame-sex relationships, and support teams rather than old-fashioned family structures. But\\nit can still prove to be true. There is certainly a woman behind Novak Djokovic’s success\\nbut not quite in the way one would expect. That woman is Jelena Gencic.\\nSome day an imaginative film-maker might like to make a film about the relationship\\nbetween Djokovic and Gencic. It might be called ‘Nole and Jeca’ after the names the two\\nused to call each other (‘Nole’ is a classic nickname for ‘Novak’, pronounced ‘No-lay’;\\n‘Jeca’, pronounced ‘Yet-sa’, is a common short form for Jelena among a certain age\\ngroup). It would be a quiet, understated film, in which the eyes of the boy playing Novak\\nwould be crucially important and the use of classical music would play a central part,\\nperhaps with the Adagietto from Mahler’s fifth symphony reprising \\nthe haunting role it\\nplayed in Luchino Visconti’s 1971 epic \\nDeath in Venice\\n. The scope is certainly there\\nbecause the relationship between the two is a remarkable one, partly because it defies all\\nconventional attempts to categorise it. And while Djokovic would probably have become a\\ngreat tennis player without Gencic, it’s likely he wouldn’t have become the person he is\\nwithout her.\\nAs well as Djokovic, Gencic worked with Monica Seles and played a minor but\\nsignificant part in the formative years of Goran Ivanisevic. For that, she is entitled to be\\nregarded as one of the leading tennis coaches of her era. She not only rejected that notion,\\nshe didn’t even like calling herself a tennis coach. In an era where it’s virtually impossible\\nto do anything professionally unless you have a formal qualification, she coached until a\\nweek before her death having never taken a test or exam that led to a tennis-coaching\\nqualification. Her university degree was in art history, she had a secondary qualification in\\npsychology, and her career was as a television producer, editor and director.\\nJelena Gencic was born in October 1936 to a Serb father and Austrian mother. The\\nfamily was moderately prominent in Yugoslavia. Her grandfather Lazar Gencic studied\\nmedicine in Vienna and went on to become surgeon general and set up a military hospital.\\nHe was a great believer in a healthy mind residing in a healthy body and insisted on\\noutdoor exercise for his children and grandchildren every day, whatever the weather. Her\\ngreat-uncle was interior minister in the first Yugoslav government after the First World War.\\nHer father Jovan wanted to be a pianist – it didn’t work out but he became a respected\\nlawyer. And she had an aunt, Ana Marinkovic, who was a prominent artist (1882–1973). As\\na child she followed her father’s example and learned the piano to a high level, but her\\npassions were two sports: tennis and handball. She played for the Yugoslav national\\nhandball team and won 32 national tennis titles.\\nAt that time, tennis was an amateur sport and Yugoslavia was a country with a\\ncollectivist (state-controlled) economy. Gencic had everything paid for but was expected to\\ngive something back, in the form of helping youngsters. She therefore began informal\\ncoaching well before her tournament-playing days ended in 1976.\\nThe restrictions of Tito’s Yugoslavia in the 1950s and 1960s meant that only the best two\\nplayers were allowed to travel abroad. There were no entourages the way there are today,',\n",
       " 'and Gencic would frequently have to play a match at Wimbledon or Forest Hills (the former\\nhome of the US Open) the day after an arduous journey. It was one early-round defeat that\\nstarted her on the road to helping the likes of Seles and Djokovic. ‘Because I knew that\\nwhen I stopped playing tournaments I wanted to help young people play tennis,’ she said,\\n‘especially those who didn’t have a coach, and I knew I wanted to explain and show them\\nhow to play, I used a defeat in the second round at Forest Hills to go out and buy some\\nbooks. America has very good articles and books about tennis, so I bought nothing but\\ntennis books, that’s the only thing I bought, in particular Vic Braden, and I built up my\\nlibrary.’\\nBy the time tennis went ‘open’ (professional) in 1968, Gencic was 31 and, realistically,\\npast the age when she could earn her living as a player. Besides, by then her career in\\ntelevision was well in train. But inevitably she was asked to get involved in the\\nadministration of tennis. As she had played for Partizan Belgrade (the leading clubs in\\nmany European cities are multi-sports clubs, so Belgrade’s teams Partizan and Red Star\\nare widely known as football teams but have all sorts of other sporting teams too, including\\ntennis), the board of the tennis club asked her to join them with a view to preparing her to\\nbe president of the club and possibly the Yugoslav Tennis Association. So she worked her\\nway up the lay administrator ladder, all the time doing her day job in television. It was a\\ndual existence she clearly revelled in.\\nThere was a potential overlap between her two worlds but it never actually happened –\\nshe never worked in sport in her television career. She worked almost exclusively on\\ncultural programmes, mainly history of art in Serbia and the world, but she also made\\nprogrammes on classical music and theatre. Every five years she changed her emphasis\\nas she had a lot of interests. But she never worked in sport because Yugoslav television\\ngrouped political reporting and sport together; sport and politics came under one heading,\\nwhile culture and the arts were separate.\\nThings began to change in the early 1980s when Gencic, by then in her forties, saw a\\nlittle girl who looked smaller than her eight years. She was an ethnic Hungarian from Novi\\nSad, a city in the north of Serbia whose population was made up of around 20 per cent\\nethnic Hungarians. Her name was Monica Seles. ‘She was so little, so tiny,’ Gencic\\nrecalled, ‘but I saw something in her eyes. I watch the eyes with every child. If a little boy or\\nlittle girl comes to me, and if they have the patience to look at me for more than 10 or 15\\nseconds without their eyes wandering, I say, “This boy or girl has a good concentration,\\nmotivation and patience – maybe this boy or girl would be very good at practising.” If you\\ntry to speak to a six-or seven-year-old, they’re looking all around. I was watching Monica.\\nShe was eight and her father Karolij asked me to come to Novi Sad. I ended up working\\nwith her for more than three years and doing a lot of travelling with her.’\\nMany accounts say Gencic coached Seles. She was never her formal coach – she was\\neffectively captain of the Yugoslav Tennis Association’s juniors and therefore travelled\\nwith the country’s best youngsters. Seles was not the only one of whom great things were\\nexpected: there was another gifted Yugoslav tennis player just a year and a half older than\\nSeles, a Croatian boy called Goran Ivanisevic. Gencic accompanied Seles and Ivanisevic\\nto tournaments like Bruehl in Germany (Steffi Graf’s home town) and Blois in France, and\\nGencic gave Seles and Ivanisevic coaching tips. But the only formal coaches Seles ever\\nhad were her father Karolij and her brother Zoltan, in the sense that they spent hours on\\ncourt with her (she doesn’t even count Nick Bollettieri as her coach, even though she\\nacknowledges the immense value of the assistance he gave her).\\nThe shift in Gencic would probably have happened anyway – with her sporting,',\n",
       " 'emotional and educational make-up, it’s hard to see her not having become a tennis coach\\nin some way. But what seeing Seles did for her was to put her various skills together and\\ngoad her into helping young tennis players formally. One day, when she was off work sick,\\nshe said to herself, ‘Jelena, some day you will stop working on television. We don’t have a\\ncoach, you’ve been a tennis teacher at university, you’ve got a second degree in\\npsychology – why don’t you become a coach? It’s easy to teach everyone forehands,\\nbackhands and smashes but not how to win matches, how to be mentally strong. How do\\nyou recognise a future champion? I could learn something myself too.’ It was more than\\njust learning. Gencic was one of seven children (four girls, three boys) but never had\\nchildren of her own. Working with Seles was the start of her own extended family, the start\\nof a process that saw her work with a number of talented youngsters.\\nSeles speaks very highly of Gencic:\\nI have so much respect for her – not just [because of] what she’s done in tennis but\\nwhat she’s done for women and girls in Serbia. Women were not put on the same rank\\nas men, they didn’t have the same opportunities – my father was always fighting for us\\nto have good facilities to practise, I started by playing in a parking lot and it was one of\\nthe reasons we decided to leave when I was 11 – we often just couldn’t get a court.\\nJelena was a pioneer in women’s sports, and Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic\\nprobably owe more to her than they realise. I never saw her after I was 11 years old\\nbut I remember her very fondly. She was a very positive influence, always smiling.\\nShe was a gentle soul who dedicated her life to tennis in a country where tennis and\\nwomen had no real place in the sports culture.\\nThe ‘gentle soul’ found herself tested with the young Ivanisevic, who even at that stage\\nwas known as a wild child. ‘When we were alone, I never had a problem with him,’ she\\nsaid. ‘Goran, Monica and me – we travelled everywhere together and everyone asked me\\nhow I handled Ivanisevic. And I replied, “He’s an excellent boy.” I never told him any ugly\\nwords, I’m always positive. Everyone had a problem with him except me. Monica helped\\nme handle Goran too – they were very close. They were like a son and daughter of mine.’\\nThe general gist of that comment may be true, but lest anyone think it was all plain\\nsailing, it wasn’t. Gencic was with Seles and Ivanisevic for the European under-14\\nchampionships in Heidelberg – the 12-year-old Seles dutifully won (she was only four\\nyears away from winning the French Open) but Ivanisevic was disqualified in the semi-\\nfinals, having behaved badly and broken at least one racket. ‘His nerves were so bad,’\\nGencic admitted, ‘it was very ugly to see.’ On another occasion, Gencic, Seles and\\nIvanisevic shared a room together at the prestigious Orange Bowl tournament, a situation\\nripe for tensions to rise inside the head of the wild child. One afternoon, while Gencic and\\nSeles were having a nap, Ivanisevic ripped the head off Seles’ doll. ‘Jelena punished me,’\\nrecalls Ivanisevic. ‘She said, “Don’t do that again,” and I had to run laps, all because I took\\nthe head off the doll.’ Asked why he felt the need to decapitate a doll, Ivaniseivc replies,\\n‘Because it was an ugly doll and it was getting on my nerves. When you’re 12, you do\\nthese stupid things.’ Seles has no recollection of this incident.\\n*\\nIn 1992 the president of Genex, the state tourism operator in Yugoslavia, asked Gencic if\\nshe would be the director of a tennis camp it wanted to run at its complex in Kopaonik.\\nKopaonik is a ski and walking resort in the mountains on the Serbian-Kosovo border. It',\n",
       " 'does well during the winter months but, despite its setting in picturesque countryside, it\\nstruggles a little in the summer months. So running summer-holiday tennis courses on the\\nhandful of hard courts it had built opposite a small shopping precinct seemed a good idea.\\nGencic was interested but had the problem that the summer camp was nine weeks. She\\nhadn’t taken any holiday but even to use up her entire holiday allowance wouldn’t have\\ncovered the nine weeks. But the board of Yugoslav TV decided to give her an extra three\\nweeks, so she was able to say yes. There was no question of a fee – Gencic didn’t want\\none and the camp was effectively run by the state, so while she didn’t get any payment,\\nshe did get all the equipment she wanted and enough coaches for one per court. That\\nallowed her to work out her programme, tell the coaches what she wanted and keep a\\nwatchful brief, monitoring all the courts like a foreman. Because Jelena Gencic was a\\nname that meant something to the parents of athletic youngsters, the camp proved very\\npopular.\\nAfter about an hour on the first morning, Gencic became aware of a small boy who\\nwasn’t part of the group but who had pressed himself against the fence behind one of the\\ncourts and was watching the action intently. At first she ignored him but after a while, with\\nthe boy still there, she remarked to one of the coaches that they had a very keen spectator.\\nShe then moved to another court and observed that the boy moved court too so he could\\nsee what Gencic was monitoring. He stayed there until the end of the session.\\nAs the camp broke for lunch, Gencic walked up to the boy and said, ‘Hello, I saw you\\nwatching us. Do you know which sport this is?’\\nThe boy replied, ‘Yes, this is tennis. I tried to play one month ago in Belgrade.’\\n‘How old are you?’ she asked.\\n‘Five.’\\n‘OK, would you like to play with us?’ asked Gencic.\\n‘I’ve been waiting for you to ask me to join you,’ he said.\\nGencic took a step back at this boldness by the tiny boy. ‘All right,’ she said, ‘you can\\njoin us this afternoon. What’s your name?’\\n‘Novak. Novak Djokovic.’\\n‘How long are you staying here?’\\n‘I’m here all summer.’\\n‘You live here or what?’\\n‘My mother and father work here; they have a pizzeria just across from the tennis court.’\\n‘Can you come at two o’clock? We’re having lunch now for two hours and at two we will\\ncontinue working. Do you have a racket?’\\n‘Yes, I do.’\\n‘Do you have shoes and everything?’\\n‘Yes, I do.’\\n‘All right, see you at two.’\\nBefore leaving for her lunch, Gencic called over her coaches and told them, ‘Please\\nwatch this boy. In particular, watch his eyes. He came alone, without parents, without\\nanyone – that’s very interesting.’\\nGencic’s apartment in Kopaonik was also close to the courts, in a high-rise building, so\\nshe could see the courts from her window. At 1.30pm she looked down and saw the boy\\nwaiting with his kit bag. So she made sure she was there before 2pm. ‘I’m sorry,’ she lied\\nto him, ‘I’ve forgotten your name.’\\n‘My name is Novak,’ he said. ‘You should not forget my name.’\\n‘I’m sorry, son, I’ll never forget your name again.’',\n",
       " 'She looked at his kit bag and said, ‘OK, come in, let’s talk about tennis. What do you\\nhave in your bag?’\\n‘Everything I need,’ the boy replied, showing her one racket, one bottle of water, two\\nsweatbands, a towel, a banana and three clean T-shirts.\\n‘How do you know what you need?’\\n‘I’ve seen it on TV.’\\n‘Who have you seen on TV?’\\n‘Sampras, Agassi, Edberg.’ It was the second week of Wimbledon, so there was a lot of\\ntennis on television at that time.\\n‘Who packed your bag?’ Gencic asked. ‘Your mother?’\\nThe boy frowned with anger. ‘I packed it! I’m playing tennis here, not my mother.’\\n‘Oh, Novak, that’s the second mistake I’ve made – please forgive me.’\\nOnly in December 2012, more than 20 years later, did Djokovic admit to Gencic that he’d\\nlied and his mother had indeed packed the bag, not him, although he had told her what she\\nneeded to pack from his television research. But somehow it doesn’t seem to matter – he\\nwas making a statement and Gencic got the message. ‘He was five years old and so\\nstrong,’ she said. ‘He was convinced I should not forget his name – I hadn’t forgotten, I was\\ntesting him, I’ve always tested him – and his ability to keep his eyes focused on me when\\nwe were talking made me think right away that this was a very unusual boy.’\\n \\nGencic insisted that she saw enough in that first afternoon to know that she had a potential\\nworld-beater on her hands. At the time, Monica Seles was world No. 1 in women’s tennis\\nand here was a boy who she said she felt could be the same in men’s tennis.\\nI tested him the way I test all my beginners, and he could do everything. At first I\\nshowed him how to hit strokes, but I soon realised that he had great motor skills,\\nmassive concentration, an ability to listen and watch. I called other coaches over and\\nsaid, ‘Watch this boy.’ Within a few minutes I offered to hit with him – he was so happy.\\nI had three or four coaches I’d been working with for about 20 years and I called one of\\nthem over and said, ‘I don’t want to say this but I’ll do it anyway – I predict that Novak\\nwon’t be in that group for long, he’ll be in the older group.’ I didn’t want to say he was\\nexcellent because he had to show that he is. I didn’t want to put pressure on him – he\\nhad to fight for it mentally.\\nAt the end of the day, Gencic asked the boy to introduce her to his parents. It wasn’t a long\\ntrip as the pizzeria was just across the road. And so ensued the conversation that was to\\nset Djokovic on the road to being the world’s best tennis player. Gencic explained:\\nHe was standing behind his mother with his head nestling into her side. I told his\\nparents what I’d seen in Novak and said, ‘You have a golden child. In the eight years\\nsince I stopped working with Monica Seles, I’ve never found as great a talent as your\\nchild. By the time he’s 17, he’ll be in the top five in the world.’ They were shocked.\\nThey looked at each other and looked at me. They didn’t know who I was, they only\\nknew that I was a coach at this camp. Suddenly it became clear how much emotion\\nthere was between Novak and me. When I said he’d be in the top five when he’s 17,\\nslowly, one step after another, Novak came up to me and put his head in my back. I\\nknew that our emotions were on the same wavelength.\\nSuch was Gencic’s recollection of the events of that late June day in 1992. Is it really true?',\n",
       " 'It’s a great tale but has the story perhaps improved with the telling? Possibly it has – after\\nall, Gencic was a consummate film-maker who knew how to bring artistic and \\ncultural\\nstories to life through her television work, so it’s possible a few details have been\\nembellished. But Djokovic himself has corroborated a lot of it in interviews, and others who\\nwere around at the time say it all stacks up.\\nA central feature of Gencic is that she was interested only in tennis and personal\\ndevelopment. She was not into money – she received countless offers to run private tennis\\ncamps but always turned them down. She was a woman of left-of-centre political views\\nand was clearly at home in a state-controlled economy where, if a service was offered, it\\nwas offered to everyone regardless of income or other means. She said, ‘I was a tennis\\nplayer, so I didn’t want to receive anything, I wanted only to help.’ She also had a\\ndeferential attitude to those she coached: ‘I never say I’m the best, I only try to get better\\nand help the children get better. The best is the child who is No. 1.’ In the course of her\\ninterviews for this book, she was given plenty of opportunities to claim clairvoyant skills for\\nother aspects of Djokovic’s progression but declined, often with a firm ‘no’. So even if the\\nstory has improved with the telling, it is likely to be a true story at heart.\\nHowever true it is, the sequence of events was weird and rushed enough for Dijana and\\nSrdjan Djokovic to have been forgiven for being a tad mistrustful when this fifty-something\\ncoach walked into their restaurant with their first-born and said he could be a world-beater\\nby 17. Gencic had clearly got the bit between her teeth and was purring enthusiastically\\nabout little Novak. She even claimed to have said to them, ‘This boy is mine, I must make\\nhim the best in the world,’ which sounds almost dangerous. Shortly afterwards, she said,\\nshe came to the conclusion that she needed to give up everything except her TV job –\\nwhich she needed to earn her living – to make sure Djokovic had the start he needed.\\nAt first the Djokovics didn’t say a word. Then they went away and tried to find out who\\nthis strange woman was and whether she \\nwas as crazy as she seemed. Everyone who\\nknew her told them she had discovered and worked with Monica Seles, which at the time\\nwas about the best reference she could have had. So they let Gencic work with their boy.\\nShe did, however, bring them somewhat down to earth the following day. She told them,\\n‘If you want me to work with Novak, I have only one condition – I will do my best for his\\ntennis but don’t ask me about money – that’s your problem not mine.’ Gencic knew that\\nwithin a couple of years they would need much more money for equipment, tournaments,\\ntravel, etc. Initially, it all came free – Gencic didn’t charge anything; she used her position\\nas president of Partizan Belgrade, one of only two state-funded tennis clubs in the country,\\nto get him rackets, balls and everything else he needed. But to make it in the fiercely\\ncompetitive world of professional tennis, he would need to find some money before long.\\nGencic and Djokovic started to work on day two of the summer camp. Gencic worked out\\na programme for him – one that lasted for five years. It needed to take account of the fact\\nthat he went to school in Belgrade but spent the summer months and part of the winter in\\nKopaonik when there was money to be made from the pizzeria and the boutique. He only\\nhad three weeks’ Christmas holiday but Gencic went to his head teacher and asked for\\none week more so she could do more work with him.\\nGencic’s insistence that she would look after the tennis but the family had to find the\\nmoney shielded the young boy from the family’s and country’s growing financial\\nchallenges, which were becoming more acute anyway – the Serbo-Croat war was raging\\nand an embryonic capitalist system was replacing the collectivist economy that had been\\nYugoslavia’s reality since 1945. The programme she prepared for him was not just a\\ncoaching plan but also a tournament plan for years one to five, including how much it was',\n",
       " 'likely to cost year by year and thus how much money the family \\nhad to be prepared to find.\\n‘This is the terrible part of the Djokovic family’s life,’ she said. ‘I knew they didn’t have\\nanything but neither did I. So I said they had to go to find some sponsors. They did find the\\nmoney but with some terrible conditions. Srjdan has said publicly that he got loans with\\nhigh interest rates, and when the day came to pay the money back and he hadn’t got any,\\nhe sometimes found a knife at his throat. The only way out was to take out a second loan to\\npay off the first loan, normally at very high rates.’\\nThese days, while Djokovic enjoys a very high standing among his compatriots, the\\nsame cannot be said for the rest of his family. His father and uncle have made enemies,\\nboth in broad society and specifically in tennis. In early 2011 a coup led by the Djokovic\\nfamily resulted in the president of the Serbian Tennis Federation, Slobodan Zivojinovic,\\nbeing ousted shortly after Serbia had won the 2010 Davis Cup and replaced by Vuk\\nJeremic, the president of the United Nations General Assembly and an ally of Srdjan\\nDjokovic. But Gencic said the wider context has to be understood:\\nPeople who criticise his parents don’t know or don’t want to know the full story of the\\nDjokovic family from the beginning. They see only money now; they think he [Srdjan]\\nis arrogant. The family were very friendly until they needed money for Novak. That\\nwas terrible. They knew that Novak would be the best, but how do you find money?\\nThey went out every day looking for money. Srdjan did get very angry but then he\\nknocked on every door, including the government’s, asking for help – he constantly\\ncame up against ‘Who is this boy?’, ‘We don’t have money for this little boy.’ Now they\\nlike to say, ‘We made him.’ I’m very happy for Srdjan to claim the credit for it because\\nwhat he did allowed Novak to go to tournaments. The Djokovic family has had a\\nterrible life until now. These days they have the money but I’m not interested how\\nthey’re living. I’m only interested in how Novak and [his younger brothers] Marko and\\nDjordje are doing.\\nThe work developing Novak Djokovic into a world-class tennis player progressed slowly\\nbut surely. He learned quickly but was a small boy, so Gencic sometimes had to wait for\\nhis body to catch up before she could move forward.\\nHaving grown up in the pre-Connors and pre-Evert era, Gencic’s natural inclination was\\nto teach the one-handed backhand. So for the first year or so of his tennis career, Djokovic\\nhit his backhand one-handed. Then one day, when he was about six and a half, he walked\\nup to Gencic and asked very politely, ‘Please, Jeca, can I try to play the backhand with two\\nhands?’ Gencic replied, ‘Of course, why not, but first of all I must explain to you how you\\nmust hold the racket for a two-handed backhand because you have three options: a left-\\nhanded forehand, a one-handed backhand with the second hand, or a genuinely two-\\nhanded shot. Try all three and after a week you will tell me which one is the best for you,\\nand whether you want to play with two hands or one hand.’ Exactly a week later, Djokovic\\ncame up to her unprompted, saying, ‘A week has passed and I’d like to explain to you – I’d\\nlike to play the backhand with two hands.’ She told him that was OK, as long as he stuck to\\na one-handed backhand slice and worked on it as a tool to get him to the net. He said he\\nfelt his backhands were much stronger with two hands than with one, so she said, ‘OK,\\nwe’ll go to work on that.’ They then worked very slowly without any pressure from Gencic,\\nbut she found him so intelligent and able to learn that he picked up the two-handed\\nbackhand very quickly.\\nOne of Djokovic’s principal attributes is his footwork, and he was complimented on that\\nfrom the beginning. Gencic said she recognised from day one that he was a good skier,',\n",
       " 'something she could also claim for herself, so essentially she taught him to adapt the basic\\nflexibility \\nin the ankles and legs that are core features for the skier to his tennis game. That\\neven allowed him to slide on hard courts, something that’s a common feature today but\\nwas very rare then.\\nAnother feature of Gencic’s coaching was that she tried to link it with the heroes her kids\\nwere seeing on television. She asked Djokovic what appealed to him when he saw the\\nlikes of Pete Sampras, Stefan Edberg and Andre Agassi playing in the biggest tennis\\narenas. On one occasion Djokovic said he wanted to play Sampras’s running down-the-\\nline forehand, so Gencic said she’d teach him. He wanted to serve and volley like Edberg,\\nso she taught him that (and was a little aggrieved that he doesn’t do that much of it as a\\nprofessional). And when he said he wanted to hit Agassi’s forehand, Gencic told him to\\nwatch where Agassi was standing during rallies. ‘Agassi stands inside the baseline,’ she\\nsaid, ‘so I taught him to stay on or inside the baseline. This was important because he was\\nvery little and didn’t have much power, so he had to take the ball early and go forward, with\\na very fast follow-through. He looked at Agassi, and started to play that way. That was\\ngood, because he didn’t have much power so he had to finish points much sooner than\\nyou think. I told him not to get involved in long rallies – when you get a shorter ball, go for\\nit.’\\nDjokovic also had very good volleys but was reluctant to make great use of them. He\\nonce told her, ‘Jeca, you want me to play volleys, but when I go to the net I feel like I’m in a\\nbattlefield facing a thousand bombs.’\\nAnother observation Gencic made about the young Novak was that he never once said\\nhe was tired. In fact, he was more likely to ask to stay another hour at the end of the\\nprogrammed practice period. ‘They were all playing four hours in the morning,’ she said of\\nher camps in Kopaonik, ‘then two hours off and then two hours more in the afternoon – so\\nsix hours including two hours of fitness work. We did it every day except when it was\\nraining.’\\nAnd he never tired mentally. Whenever they finished a practice session, Gencic knew\\nthe boy would ask her something about what they were doing. At one stage she said to\\nhim, ‘Novak, I have two university degrees – I think I now have a third degree because of\\nall your questions I’ve answered!’\\nGencic even claimed she had done her best to make him taller. ‘He was very late in\\ngrowing,’ she observed.\\nI read physiology books and asked people which exercises they could do to make a\\nboy taller. And I found nine exercises every day, three times a day, and you will be\\ntaller than you would have been. They’re very easy but you must really work at them; if\\nyou don’t work, you don’t get anywhere. I worked on fitness but only on the tennis\\ncourt, only on flexibility and agility, speed off the mark. I never worked on power with\\nhim, and no long-distance running. When you’re through puberty, you can start to work\\non power and your musculature will be long, which gives them flexibility and you can\\nthen work on the strength. But I wasn’t coaching him by then.\\nAs the months went by, word spread that this was a boy worth watching. Part of that word\\nwas spread by the boy himself. At seven he was invited on to a national television\\nprogramme where children interview children – appearing with the peak of his cap turned\\nto the back, he turned in a very cocksure performance that included the prediction that he\\nwould be No. 1 in the world. The clip is still available on the Internet, and even if you don’t\\nunderstand Serbian you can see the confidence shining through – but it’s the seven-year-',\n",
       " 'old’s confidence without arrogance; he was just answering a question as honestly as he\\ncould. ‘When I was seven or eight, I said I was going to be world No. 1,’ Djokovic told the\\nAmerican television station CBS in 2012, ‘and most of the \\npeople laughed at me. Those\\nwere very critical times for our country, so it seemed like I had a one per cent chance to do\\nthat.’ But he believed he could do it and even enacted the scene of his greatest individual\\ntriumph that was to come nearly 20 years later – he fashioned a trophy-like vessel out of a\\ncheap plastic vase and, speaking English for one of the first times in his life, raised the\\nvase above his head with the words, ‘Hello, I’m Novak Djokovic, I’m Wimbledon\\nchampion.’\\nThe precocity of the young Novak was spotted by a man who was later to become a\\nDavis Cup team-mate and one of his coaches, Dusan Vemic. Vemic, 11 years older than\\nDjokovic, was still in the youth squad at the Partizan club in Belgrade when he found his\\nsquad coaching sessions taking place on a neighbouring court to one being used by\\nGencic to coach the seven-year-old Djokovic. ‘Even at that stage, he was almost\\nindependent in some way,’ recalls Vemic. ‘You could see he was like those kids brought\\non to TV shows as little prodigies in different spheres of life – maths, music – they’re like\\nlittle professors. He was one of those kids: very intelligent, very eloquent, great ideas, very\\nclear in his head. He had something about him and the whole situation brought out more\\nfrom him. The tougher the situation, the better he is. He’s proved that over and over as a\\nprofessional.’\\nAlthough he was spending three-quarters of the year in Belgrade, Djokovic thought of\\nKopaonik as his tennis home. He would play on the three hard courts in summer and, in\\nwinter, when those courts were covered with snow, he would profit from the indoor sports\\nfacility at the Grand Hotel, which had been built by the state tourism authorities in the\\n1980s and could be used as an indoor tennis court. Together with the clay courts of the\\nBelgrade facilities, it gave him access to hard, clay and indoor surfaces, so a well-rounded\\ntennis education. But it wasn’t all tennis – Gencic wanted all the boys and girls on her\\ncamps to \\nsocialise together, so it was a massive youthful community with all the\\nfriendships and frictions that go with it. Reminiscing with Gencic in his twenties, Djokovic\\nsaid to her, ‘You know, Jeca, Kopaonik is my Mount Olympus.’\\n \\nDjokovic refers to Gencic as his ‘tennis mother’, and having coached him from when he\\nwas five until he was twelve, she certainly taught him the fundamentals of tennis. But she\\nsaw her role as much wider than that.\\nIf the term hadn’t been commandeered by a branch of the personal development\\nindustry, you could describe Gencic as Djokovic’s life coach, in the sense that she\\ncoached him in various aspects of life that she knew he would have to deal with. She\\ntaught him about table manners; she recognised that the family he came from had just\\nabout enough to live on but no more, but that as a top-level tennis player he would sit at\\ntables with more than one knife and one fork, more than one glass, so she told him which\\nglass was for the aperitif, which for the white wine, which for the champagne, etc.\\nMindful of the pride involved in a patriarchal family where a woman had come in to\\ncoach the eldest son in a discipline the family was unfamiliar with, Gencic insisted she\\nonly ever told him about table manners and such like when they were alone. And only\\nonce did Djokovic ask me why she was telling him about etiquette. ‘Every day I told him,\\n“You will be the best in the world,” starting from the second day I knew him. I said we must\\nwork, we must believe each other. If you don’t understand something, you must ask me. If\\nyou feel you haven’t put the work in, put it in. I told his parents, “Don’t put pressure on your',\n",
       " 'child, he has to be an individual. The motivation has to come from him.” But these kinds of\\nthings I said privately, so Novak didn’t hear what I told his parents and his parents didn’t\\nhear everything I told him.’\\nAs well as etiquette, Gencic was very big into music, literature and general education.\\nOne day she told him she liked classical music and, when she was tired, she would lie\\ndown and listen to some. She suggested he did the same and introduced him to some of\\nthe classics. She said,\\nI always explained who the composer was. I explained if it was baroque, classical,\\nromantic, who Beethoven was, etc. What we listened to depended on his tiredness\\nand level of interest. When he was very tired, we listened to Chopin, Debussy, Grieg –\\npiano music to which we can slowly relax. And very often because we often finished\\nthe day near my home, I played pieces on the piano for him. The first time he was\\nlistening, I saw in his eyes that he would prefer to listen to heavy metal and such like\\nbut I said he had to learn to listen to classical as well. He would listen to rock and\\nheavy metal for half an hour before he went to bed, so he had both. I never said, ‘Don’t\\ndo it.’ That’s a terrible thing to say to a youngster.\\nOne day, when he was about seven, I was very tired, maybe a bit depressed, and\\nwas looking for a piece of music to put on. I like to listen to strong music, full orchestra\\nmusic, so I played the 1812 Overture – for myself. And I saw him – he was listening, so\\nI turned the volume up a little. Suddenly Novak told me, ‘Jeca, I’ve got goose bumps.’\\nHe was listening so strongly. I said, ‘OK, Novak, I’ll explain something very important.\\nIn a match, you’ll be in one of two situations. It could be a very good situation where\\nyou’re closing in on victory, one or two points away from winning, and you’ll feel\\ngoose bumps. In that situation, be quiet and finish the match, don’t get excited, stay\\ncalm. But you may be a few points from losing a match, so remember this music and\\nthe feeling, remember both, and the adrenalin will start to kick in and you may well\\nwin.’ I think this lesson has been so important for his mental strength.\\nAlongside the poets – particularly Serbian and Russian ones – Gencic encouraged\\nDjokovic to learn at least two languages other than his mother tongue. English was an\\nobvious one and he chose German as his second, which came in useful when he began\\ngoing to Munich at the age of 12.\\nAnd she taught Djokovic about Nikola Tesla. To most travellers, Tesla is just the name\\nof Belgrade’s international airport but the man himself was a leading, if somewhat\\neccentric, figure in the history of science. A Serb who emigrated to America, he is credited\\nwith being the father of alternating current, the AC in AC/DC (DC stands for direct current),\\nand some credit him with the science underlying the major discoveries associated with\\nEdison, Marconi and others. Gencic knew a lot about Tesla and one day found an article\\nabout him in a newspaper that had a good cultural section for children. Djokovic, then\\nabout seven and a half, was very interested and asked her a question about Tesla. Gencic\\nreplied with, ‘What’s the first idea of Nikola Tesla? Answer: visualisation. First Tesla saw\\nin his mind a new idea, then he put it down on paper and then tried to realise it.’ Only once\\ndid Djokovic ask her what ‘visualisation’ means. He asked, ‘Do you think you will see into\\nthe future what will happen?’ – this at seven. Gencic explained that, for tennis tactics,\\nvisualisation is a very important part of practice. So she played Smetana’s symphonic\\npoem \\nVltava\\n to him, saying he should listen, and when she stopped the music he had to\\ntell her what he saw, what he felt and anything else about the music – in short, what he\\nvisualised. Then Gencic shared with him what she had been feeling. She admits to one',\n",
       " 'mistake with \\nVltava\\n – she told him it was a river but that was because she felt a seven-\\nyear-old needed a helping hand, \\nwhich this particular seven-year-old probably didn’t. At\\ntimes they visualised with a different piece of music every day, which explains why\\nDjokovic has a very good knowledge of classical music and still uses it to calm his mind\\ntoday.\\nThe Gencic teaching extended to aspects of nature as and when they encountered them.\\nShe once offered her summer group in Kopaonik the option of a training session or a four-\\nhour walk in the mountains – they all, including Djokovic, opted for the walk in the\\nmountains. She told them about the fauna and flora, often explaining why she liked\\nsomething. She taught him what to pick to make up a small bouquet. One day, when he\\nwas about nine, he made a really big and beautiful bouquet; an impressed Gencic\\ncomplimented him and picked a blue flower that she felt would go well in it. He looked and\\nsaid, ‘But Jeca, don’t you see? I have this flower in there already.’ Indeed he had, she just\\nhadn’t noticed, and stood corrected. It transpired it was his mother’s birthday that day and it\\nwas clearly important to him that he should make his own bouquet for her free from any\\noutside influence.\\nAnd, of course, as the niece of a leading artist, the broad education included art. This\\nwas a message the young Novace picked up very quickly (in the first few months Gencic\\ncalled him ‘Novace’, pronounced ‘No-VA-chay’). When he was seven and a half and her\\nbirthday was approaching, he insisted to his parents that he wanted to buy her a present –\\na painting. He spent two hours looking for the right one and eventually found it in a market.\\nIt hung in her living room until her death, among the more critically acclaimed Marinkovic\\nworks.\\nTo what extent Djokovic would have been the person he is without the influence of\\nJelena Gencic will never be known. He clearly had the confidence to take in her wide-\\nranging package of education, and the intellectual capacity to know where she was\\ncoming from and why what she was teaching him would help him in the future. Given the\\ndetermination it takes to get to the top of a ferociously competitive global sport, it’s distinctly\\npossible Djokovic would have had a much rockier road to the top without her input. He\\nmight have pursued a route similar to Andre Agassi’s – Agassi’s natural curiosity and good\\nnature eventually triumphed over the rebelliousness of his unchannelled youthful\\naggression, but it took many years and may well have cost him half a dozen Grand Slam\\nsingles titles.\\nFrom the beginning, Gencic had an unshakeable belief that Djokovic would be the best\\nin the world, so she saw her role as teaching him to speak very well as much as teaching\\nhim a good backhand, encouraging him to speak good English as much as encouraging\\nhim to go to the net, and to be very helpful and diplomatic. She maintained he loves\\neverybody – he probably doesn’t, but he does a good job of making those with whom he\\ncomes into contact feel very loved.\\n \\nThe relationship between a coach and a player is a strange one. Some coaches are\\nanathema to some players but a match made in heaven with others. It takes a certain\\nchemistry, perhaps allied to the right timing. For some players, Gencic might have been a\\ndisaster – maybe there is a potential champion who missed the boat because he or she\\nhad a Gencic figure, rather than a more traditional nuts-and-bolts coach. But she was so\\nright for Djokovic.\\nAnd even in what proved to be the last few months of her life, she never described\\nherself as a professional coach. ‘I’m not professional because that means you work for',\n",
       " 'money but I never work for money,’ she said. ‘I don’t want money because I coach children.\\nIf their parents have no money, I still want to coach them. For most of my life, the tennis\\ncourts were excellent in Yugoslavia \\nand Serbia because the government paid for\\neverything in a tennis school. We could buy balls through the tennis school, rackets and\\nstrings, and the state paid for coaching.’\\nIn some ways, she was a loveable eccentric. Even in her mid-70s she spent up to 10\\nhours a day on court, coaching and supervising other coaches, and there was no shortage\\nof children who wanted to learn. Every day she would break for her unchanging lunch of a\\nbaguette and a litre of yoghurt. One year, on her birthday, all her children and their parents\\ngave her a baguette and a litre of yoghurt as an affectionate joke.\\nOfficially, she was Djokovic’s first coach: the woman who taught him how to play tennis.\\nFrom when he was 12, when he had other coaches in Belgrade and visited Nikki Pilic’s\\nacademy in Germany at regular intervals, she became just a friend and ex-coach. He\\nfrequently visited her, but once he was full-time on the tour, he had less and less time to\\nsee her. There was a period of about four years in his early adulthood when he didn’t see\\nher at all. She said she fully understood, though there was a sense that she was a little\\nupset by the length of time she didn’t see him. During that period, Djokovic had the habit of\\nmentioning a work of classical music in some of his interviews for Serbian television or\\nradio. Sometimes he would say, ‘I like to listen to Tchaikovsky,’ or another classical\\ncomposer. Gencic interpreted this as Djokovic telling her through television that he was\\nthinking of her, even if he didn’t have time to contact her. Djokovic confirmed in an\\ninterview with her that this was how he intended it – whether he was just being nice to an\\nold lady for whom he clearly felt immense affection and gratitude is not certain, but it would\\nbe nice to believe such references to the classics genuinely were coded messages sent to\\nher.\\nAnother thing she never said but seemed to hint at was that she was sad never to have\\ntravelled with him. The family frequently \\nstruggled to find money for tickets, but\\noccasionally there was a budget for Novak to go to a junior tournament with one\\naccompanying adult. So the question was always who would go with him and it was\\nalways his father or mother, or Uncle Goran or Bogdan Obradovic – never Gencic,\\nalthough he would sometimes talk on the phone to her. Only once did Djokovic ever invite\\nher to accompany him to a tournament. That was for the first day of Wimbledon 2012 when\\nhe was opening the defence of his title at 1pm on the first day and he invited her to sit with\\nhis team in the players’ box. She said she replied, ‘Novak, if you’re only inviting me for one\\nday, I think it’s much better if it’s the last day, not the first.’ So she didn’t come and Djokovic\\nnever made it to the final – he was beaten by Roger Federer in the semis and, by the\\nfollowing year’s Wimbledon, she was dead.\\nBut if she never travelled to Wimbledon, Wimbledon came to her. At the end of the 2011\\nseason, Djokovic arranged to visit her and asked if he could bring along a TV crew. In the\\nend he brought two – one American and one Serbian – so both Serbian and US television\\ncaptured the moment when Djokovic walked through the gate of her house with his\\nWimbledon replica. ‘This was what we were working for, wasn’t it?’ he said as they gave\\neach other a heartfelt hug – he in a warm winter overcoat, she in a cricket sweater. ‘This is\\nthe trophy, this was our dream. We were standing in front of the mirror and lifting up the\\nimprovised trophy and dreaming of holding this one one day. I always wanted to do this,’\\nhe said as he placed his replica on the table containing all her trophies, ‘alongside your\\ntrophies – not just any trophy, but the one, \\nthe\\n one.’ It was a wonderful moment, not\\ncheapened in any way by the presence of the cameras.',\n",
       " 'That wasn’t the last time they saw each other but it was a form of closure. And the end\\ncame suddenly. She was on court until a week before she rapidly went down with the\\nspread of her \\nsecondary liver cancer, and she died on the middle Saturday of the 2013\\nFrench Open. Word went out on the Serbian Tennis Federation’s website at noon that day,\\nbut with Djokovic due to play Grigor Dimitrov late that afternoon in the third round in Paris,\\nDjokovic’s coach and team decided to keep the news from him. After beating Dimitrov\\ncomfortably, he did a cheerful on-court interview with Fabrice Santoro, signed a few\\nautographs as he left the court, and was then given the news.\\nNormally a post-match press conference is obligatory but he was exempted all his media\\nobligations that night. Two days later, after winning his next match, he said of the previous\\n48 hours:\\nIt hasn’t been easy but this is life – life gives you things and takes away close people.\\nJelena was my first coach, she was like my second mother – we were very close\\nthroughout all my life. She taught me a lot of things that are part of me, part of my\\ncharacter today. I have the nicest memories of her. This is something that will stay with\\nme for ever and, hopefully, I will be able to continue and follow up where she stopped\\nwith her legacy because she left so much knowledge to me and to the people who\\nwere close to her and I feel the responsibility to continue doing that in the future. She\\nworked with kids from about five and six years to 12 and 13 years old, and she\\ndedicated all her life to that generation and to tennis. She never got married, she never\\nhad kids, so tennis was all she had in life. Even last week she was giving lessons to\\nkids, so she didn’t really care about the nature of the illness – she had breast cancer\\nand she survived that. She’s one of the most incredible people I ever knew, so it’s\\nquite emotional, yeah.\\nThe Serbian Tennis Federation hastily organised a service of \\nthanksgiving in Belgrade for\\nGencic’s life. It took place two days after her death, on the second Monday of Roland\\nGarros, so there was no way Djokovic could be there. But he sent a letter, which his mother\\nread out at the service. It included the passage,\\nI am completely unprepared for our parting. Not being able to see you off makes me\\nendlessly sad. Still, I know that you’d be mad if I gave up or decreased my chance to\\nfulfil this final wish of ours, winning Roland Garros. Thank you for your patience, your\\nenormous love. Thank you for your everyday support, for the advice I remember, for\\nthe warm words which always carried an extraordinary message. You know that I’ve\\nmemorised them all and that I always follow your rules.\\nOur last conversation, two weeks ago, didn’t suggest that any-thing was wrong. I’m\\nsad because even then you made an effort to keep me free from any concerns and\\nassured me that everything was all right, that you were in the hospital for a routine\\ncheck-up – that I shouldn’t worry but win.\\nYou were an angel. Both when you coached me and afterward, I felt your support\\nwherever I went. Sincere. Strong. Unconditional. You left an indelible mark on Serbian\\ntennis. Everyone who holds a racket in his or her hands today is indebted to you. I\\npromise that I will speak your name to future generations and that your spirit will live\\non on our tennis courts.\\nIf this was a fairy tale, Djokovic would have won the French Open seven days later. But it\\nisn’t, and he didn’t. He was beaten by Rafael Nadal in a four-hour, 38-minute semi-final in',\n",
       " 'which he had his chances but, ultimately, couldn’t resist the irrepressible momentum that\\nNadal had created after seven months off the tour in 2012–13. If Gencic was Djokovic’s\\nangel, she was off guardian duty that \\nafternoon. But it’s hard not to see Djokovic having\\nthree or four more cracks at the French Open title and maybe winning it will mean just as\\nmuch a little further down the line.\\n \\nIn many ways, the person of Novak Djokovic, more than the tennis player, is Jelena\\nGencic’s legacy. She didn’t seem to mind not having had children of her own, saying, ‘All\\nboys and girls are my children,’ but it was easy to feel she would have made a wonderfully\\nnurturing mother. If Djokovic was the son she never had, he’s the kind of son any mother\\nwould be proud of. Yet perhaps she needed him too much. She said she’d had two very\\ntalented boys a couple of years after she met him but she didn’t want to work with them,\\nostensibly because she didn’t have time, what with coaching Djokovic and her TV work,\\nbut deep down she didn’t want to create competition for him. ‘I wanted to keep him to be\\nthe best in his own right,’ was how she put it. Such devotion, though admirable, can be\\nstifling, and maybe Djokovic needed to get his distance from her, which may explain the\\nfour years in which they never saw each other.\\nThere was something inspiring yet sad about Jelena Gencic. Her eyes sparkled with\\nenthusiasm, yet there was also a sadness there. If she had one regret as a professional, it\\nwas that there is very little left of her work as a television-programme maker. She ended\\nher TV career in 1999 when the Serbian television centre was destroyed in the Nato\\nbombing; the bombing destroyed the archives, so most of the 1,500 programmes she\\nmade, many of them award winners, were obliterated.\\nIf she had ever been marooned on the BBC’s fictitious ‘desert island’ (from the long-\\nrunning radio series \\nDesert Island Discs\\n) with nothing to keep her company except eight\\npieces of music, she would have wanted a Beethoven symphony (any one would do), the\\nAdagietto from Mahler’s fifth symphony, Rachmaninov’s C minor \\npiano concerto, some\\nChopin piano music and some Serbian national and church music, plus a bit of music she\\nhad composed for her television work. But knowing her, she would probably have captured\\na baboon and spent most of her time trying to teach it how to hit a coconut shell over a low\\nhorizontal branch.\\nAs Djokovic summed it up, her biggest legacy is simply her own personal ethos and\\nemotional intelligence, which distinguishes her massively from your average tennis coach.\\n‘If I give everything from my soul to a child on a tennis court,’ she said in her last interview,\\n‘this boy or girl must receive it – maybe not all of it but much of it. If they don’t receive it,\\nthat’s no motivation for me. I am very proud of Novak. This is a boy who understands me,\\nwho learned so much, who wanted to learn so much, who wanted to receive from me. And I\\nreceived from him too. The biggest thing I’ve learned is to be patient. Never be sad, explain\\nif you’re feeling sad, explain to yourself and speak to each other about it. It’s very\\nimportant.’\\nInterviewed for this book in early 2014, Djokovic looked back on the role Gencic played\\nfor him. ‘Jelena had a vision,’ he said. ‘She saw in me something special from the start.\\nShe was always preparing each of us for something greater than the game of tennis. She\\nwas preparing us for life. My family taught me to always be respectful and polite to people\\nolder than me. She was my coach, somebody who my parents chose to be my guide and\\nmentor.

       " 'CHAPTER FOUR\\nTHE EMERGENCE OF SERBIA FROM THE YUGOSLAV\\nWARS\\nI\\nt’s hard to find a country that does not have some stain on its historical character. Some\\nare easy to highlight, like Germany, a culturally mature country that has produced Goethe,\\nBeethoven and Dürer but was still capable of starting two world wars and inflicting awful\\nsuffering on a group of people simply because of their ethnic origin. Russia’s part in its war\\nagainst Japan in 1904–5 was as awful as it was stupid, sending its Baltic fleet around the\\nworld in a nine-month manoeuvre to preserve the Tsar’s prestige, only for it to be sunk in\\n45 minutes in the Tsushima Strait; Russia also has Stalin’s show trials and purges of the\\n1930s on its record. Rwanda has the horrendous genocide of 1994, Chile has its Pinochet\\nera, South Africa the apartheid era. The USA has had its fair share of dodgy deals with\\nunsavoury regimes, plus its slowness to afford non-white Americans their rights under the\\nUS constitution. And a close examination of British foreign policy over the past 200 years\\nshows \\nup all sorts of things the great empire builders wouldn’t want publicised, like the first\\nconcentration camps in the Boer War, the Amritsar massacre of 1919 and other low-profile\\nexamples of colonial arrogance and despotism.\\nAll this and more should be stated before laying too strongly into Serbia for its actions in\\nthe 1990s. But there’s no doubt it was an era in Serbian history that the likes of Novak\\nDjokovic do not reflect comfortably on. He has often spoken about how part of his\\nstatesmanlike role is to convince the world that Serbs are not all the bloodthirsty louts they\\nwere frequently depicted as on the world’s television screens in the 1990s, as Yugoslavia\\nbroke up in a wave of bloodshed. ‘I’m very conscious of that in every moment of both my\\npublic and private life,’ he says, ‘especially when I am abroad. It is something that is built-\\nin with most of us Serbs of my generation and older. We were always told that once we go\\nout of the country, there will be a lot of stereotypes attached to us because we come from\\nSerbia. They will think a lot of nasty and bad things, and we need to be very conscious\\nabout our behaviour. We are the ambassadors of our families and our country, and we\\nneed to always show the best in us. So I carry this responsibility with big respect and\\nhonour, and I hope that I am managing to portray my country in the best possible light.’\\nThe tragedy of the Yugoslav wars is that they should never have been necessary. There\\nis a view among some ethnologists that the Serbian approach to nationhood in 1918 was\\nan inclusive one – that those peoples related to the Serbs through a closeness of language\\nand religion (whether practised religion or just a label of identification with a faith) could\\neasily belong in the same country, be it a ‘Greater Serbia’ or a ‘Yugoslavia’. Not everyone\\nwould agree with this view but it is undeniable that there is generally an ease of relations\\nbetween Serbs, Montenegrins, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians and others on a personal\\nlevel, and the fact that the \\nlanguage spoken in Yugoslavia was generally known as ‘Serbo-\\nCroat’ is a reflection of how close Serbian and Croatian are.\\nYet by 1990 antagonisms between the constituent republics of Yugoslavia had reached\\nthe point where you were ‘either with us or against us’. This was bad enough in the five\\nrepublics that reflected an ethnically recognisable people: Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro,\\nSlovenia and Macedonia. It was even worse in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a small state that',\n",
       " 'didn’t really have ethnic Bosnians. The largest constituent ethnic group of Bosnians were\\nMuslim (known as Bosniaks) but with a good number of Serbs and Croats. It was here that\\nthe tragic neighbour-versus-neighbour violence – when friends and neighbours who had\\nrecently celebrated festivals together suddenly turned against each other – was at its worst\\nand left a legacy that the new republics are still recovering from today.\\nThe break-up of Yugoslavia happened in the course of four wars concentrated largely\\naround the areas where the different ethnic groups were most mixed. It’s important to\\nunderstand the difference between how the terms ‘republic’ and ‘nation’ are used in this\\npart of the world – Croatia is the republic, the Croats are the nation; Serbia the republic,\\nSerbs the nation, etc. This was a battle of nations and what happened was the emergence\\nof nationalism over citizenship, or what is often known as ‘state chauvinism’. Instead of a\\ngovernment trying to serve all the citizens in its area of jurisdiction regardless of ethnic or\\nreligious origin, the new governments were looking to rule on behalf of the majority\\n‘nation’. That inevitably relegated those who were not of the majority nation to minorities,\\nnormally discriminated against and treated as second-class citizens.\\nSome put the starting point of the wars at Tito’s death in 1980 and the chain of events\\nthat led to the wars of 1991–99 can certainly be traced back to then. But the point at which\\nwar became inevitable was probably reached in the late 1980s, when Slobodan Milosevic\\nrealised the political benefit that Serb nationalism was \\nlikely to deliver. Acting as president\\nof the Yugoslav republic of Serbia (not then a sovereign state the way today’s Serbia is),\\nMilosevic in 1989 rescinded the autonomy of the mainly Albanian province of Kosovo and\\nbegan a programme of imposing Serbian culture. The move sent shock waves through the\\nCroats and Slovenes. They feared they would be next and, when the 14th congress of the\\nYugoslav Communist Party voted in January 1990 for a multi-party system, the nationalist\\nparties seized the initiative.\\nBy the start of 1991 it was clear Yugoslavia was going to break up, but the Karadjordjevo\\nagreement between Milosevic and the equally fervent Croatian nationalist leader Franjo\\nTudjman in March 1991 meant that a bitter struggle over the ethnically mixed areas would\\nfollow. This agreement set out how both men saw the dissolution of Yugoslavia, effectively\\nby dividing Bosnia between them.\\nThree of the four wars overlapped. Skirmishes in the Serbo-Croat war of 1991–95 had\\nbegun in the early spring but in June Slovenia declared independence. For 10 days,\\nSerbia, in the form of the Yugoslav National Army, tried to bring the Slovenes back but they\\nsoon gave up and Slovenia gained its independence before the summer was out. This was\\nthe first of the wars, sometimes referred to as ‘the 10-day War’.\\nThat spurred Croatia and Macedonia to declare their independence. The Croats had\\nalready signalled that they wanted to secede and had prepared a constitution for the new\\nsovereign Republic of Croatia. That constitution reclassified the Serbs living in Croatia –\\nabout 12 per cent of the population, most of them living in the province of Krajina near the\\nSerbian border – as a ‘national minority’ when, up till then, they had been a ‘constituent\\nnation’. As Serbia’s approach under Milosevic had been that non-Serb nations could have\\ntheir own republics but that all Serbs were entitled to belong to ‘Greater Serbia’, the\\nCroatian Serbs announced \\ntheir secession from Croatia in the hope of integration into the\\nnew Serbian state.\\nThat triggered the second of the wars, often referred to as the ‘Croatian War of\\nIndependence’, although the Croatian Serbs prefer to view it as their battle for self-\\ndetermination; some call it the ‘Serbo-Croat War’ but that can be misleading because\\nethnic Serbs and Croats clashed in Bosnia too. Because of the involvement of the largely',\n",
       " 'Serbian Yugoslav National Army, which marched around 70,000 soldiers into Croatia, the\\ninitial victories went to the Serbs. The first act of ethnic cleansing took place that summer in\\nthe town of Kijevo, where Croats were rounded up and shot simply because they were\\nCroats, but more ethnic cleansing followed. One particular name, Vukovar, became a\\nsymbol for the whole Serbo-Croat war. It was a peaceful town just inside the Croatia-\\nSerbia border of around 50,000 inhabitants of mixed ethnic origin – some say there were\\n22 different nations represented among Vukovar’s residents, making it a model Yugoslav\\ntown. By July 1991 Vukovar was surrounded by the Serbs, who bombarded it for four\\nmonths; it eventually fell to the Serbs in November 1991 as hundreds of Croat patients\\nwere herded from a hospital, taken to a field and shot. Four years later, with the Croats\\nsurging west, making good the territorial losses they had suffered in the early months of the\\nwar, Vukovar was retaken and the Serbs had to flee. Vukovar is less than 20km from\\nVinkovici, where Dijana Djokovic’s family hails from.\\nThe bloodiest of the four wars was the ‘Bosnian War’ of 1992–95. Bosnia-Herzegovina\\nwas the only one of the six Yugoslav republics not to have a distinct resident nation. The\\nethnic mix was approximately 43 per cent Bosniak (Muslim), 31 per cent Serb and 17 per\\ncent Croat. The early part of the war saw the Serb-dominated Yugoslav National Army\\nbombard Bosniak territory, carrying out ethnic cleansing by killing large numbers of\\nBosnian \\nMuslims. But there were also clashes between Bosniaks and Croats, and clashes\\nwithin sub-groups of the ethnic nations.\\nThe Bosnian War lasted three and a half years and led to an estimated 100,000 deaths,\\nwith up to 50,000 women raped and around 2.2 million becoming refugees or otherwise\\ndisplaced. Most of the names that stand out from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s are from\\nthe Bosnian War, largely because it was so brutal. The Bosnian Serbs were led by\\nRadovan Karadzic, with the Bosnian Serb military commanded by Ratko Mladic – both\\nwere indicted at the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal in The Hague. Several place names\\nbecame recurring terms in the world’s news coverage – like Mostar for the destruction of its\\n427-year-old symbolic bridge, or Banja Luka for the concentration camp the Serbs set up\\nthere. But perhaps the two names that symbolise the war were Sarajevo and Srebrenica.\\nSarajevo, the Bosnian capital, had hosted the winter Olympics in 1984 but was badly\\ndamaged in a siege that began in April 1992 after Bosnia’s Muslim president Alja\\nIzetbegovic declared independence from Yugoslavia. That independence was promptly\\nrecognised by the international community, causing the Serbs to mobilise their forces\\naround the city. The siege lasted longer than the war itself, not ending until February 1996.\\nSrebrenica was a small town of about 8,000 inhabitants but that population had swollen to\\naround 40,000 because of all the Bosniaks fleeing ethnic cleansing. Supposedly under the\\nprotection of the United Nations, it was shelled and ransacked by Serb forces on Easter\\nMonday 1993, leaving dozens dead. The UN declared it a ‘safe zone’ but insufficient\\nmilitary protection was provided and in July 1995 Serb forces captured the supposedly\\ndemilitarised town and slaughtered an estimated 8,500 Bosnian men. This was the\\nepisode that later caused the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal in The Hague to declare the\\nkilling as genocide, and to censure Serbia for failure to prevent it.\\nThe Bosnian war came to an end when Nato intervened, bombing Serbian positions in\\nBosnia in August and September 1995. It was concluded with the Dayton peace accords of\\nNovember 1995, which established various ethnic rights within the borders of new\\nindependent states. The peace has held but almost in the form of a mini-Yugoslavia within\\nBosnian borders, such that national successes like qualifying for the 2014 football World\\nCup are never the source of unified national rejoicing they would be in most other',\n",
       " 'countries.\\nSo by the end of 1995, Slovenia, Macedonia, Croatia and Bosnia had all declared\\nindependence. It meant that Yugoslavia was now only Serbia and Montenegro. Yet it\\ncontinued under the name Yugoslavia, and in 1997 Slobodan Milosevic moved up from\\nbeing president of Serbia to being president of Yugoslavia. And he was not finished with\\nhis nationalist wars.\\nThe fourth war came in 1998 and centred on Kosovo. This is a conflict rich in symbolism,\\nwhich embodies many of the factors that cause territorial struggles in a world where travel\\n– and thus migration – is so easy. It is also the war that has the greatest impact on the\\nDjokovic story.\\nThe defeat of Kosovo in 1389 marked the end of Serbia’s great era of dominance in the\\nMiddle Ages and the start of the rise of the Ottoman Empire. So Kosovo had always been a\\npoignant reminder of Serbian failure. It had remained a province of Serbia but it was never\\na massively prosperous area and, from the middle of the 20th century, the Serbs tended to\\nmove north where economic prospects were better. As the Serbs moved north, ethnic\\nAlbanians moved in. These Muslim migrants, referred to by the Serbs as ‘Siptar’ (very\\nmuch a term of abuse), often bought land from the departing Serbs. More importantly, they\\nhad a phenomenally high birth rate, with the result that by the start of the 1990s Kosovo\\nhad a majority ethnic Albanian population.\\nFor most of the four decades of Tito’s Yugoslavia, Kosovo had the \\nstatus of an\\nautonomous province, but this was rescinded by Milosevic in 1989. Not only that but Serb\\nculture was imposed – Albanian radio and television were closed, Albanian teachers were\\nforbidden from teaching in schools and colleges and Albanians were fired from jobs in\\npublic-sector industries (which accounted for most industries at that time). In 1996\\ndisaffected Albanians formed the Kosovo Liberation Army, which started attacking Serbia.\\nAn agreement of sorts was reached in 1998 but it was never going to hold because the\\nethnic Albanian population wanted independence for Kosovo while Milosevic wanted it to\\nremain part of Serbia.\\nThe ‘Kosovo War’ began in 1998. The bloodshed intensified, to the point where Nato\\nordered Serbia to stop its attacks in Kosovo. Serbia refused, probably believing Nato had\\nno mandate to intervene as Kosovo was a legally constituted province of Yugoslavia. But\\nas evidence emerged of more massacres of innocent civilians, Nato eventually responded\\nby launching bombing raids on both Kosovo and Belgrade. For 76 days, from 24 March to\\n8 June 1999, Belgrade came under air attack, forcing its residents to flee to underground\\nshelters, including the Djokovic family. Eventually, Serbia accepted the United Nations’\\noffer for Kosovo to become a province under UN protection and the war ended.\\nKosovo remained a UN-protected province for nine years. Then in 2008 it declared\\nindependence. It was recognised by most of the international community but a few states –\\nnotably Russia, China and five EU members – supported Serbia by not recognising\\nKosovo as a sovereign state. In April 2013 the EU brokered a deal under which the Serbs\\nin northern Kosovo are guaranteed a community of Serb municipalities in both the north\\nand the south of Kosovo; Belgrade denied that the deal meant Serbia recognised Kosovo’s\\nindependence, saying it was just to regularise the situation in the short term so both Serbia\\nand Albania could negotiate their accession to the EU.\\nThese days no more than about 10 per cent of Kosovo’s population is Serb but the\\nSerbs still form a majority in about a quarter of Kosovo’s land – around the city of Mitrovica\\nwhere Srdjan Djokovic, Novak’s father, grew up. The Serb-Albanian tensions continue to\\nsimmer but, with the two countries wanting to join the European Union and the EU saying',\n",
       " 'this can only happen with ‘full normalisation’ of relations (whatever that comes to mean in\\npractice), some lasting solution needs to be found. As part of ‘full normalisation’, the EU\\nhas insisted that Serbia should cooperate in bringing the last two war-crimes suspects\\n(Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic) to justice. Meanwhile, Kosovo exists in a sort of limbo –\\na state recognised by many but not by enough to become a United Nations member. This\\nmeans, for example, that it can’t join Uefa or Fifa, so a football player such as Manchester\\nUnited’s Adnan Januzaj, whose parents are ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, couldn’t play\\nfor Kosovo in international competitions if he wanted to – except in friendly matches – as\\nKosovo isn’t admitted (ironically, Januzaj could choose to play for either Serbia or Albania\\nby dint of having Kosovan parents).\\nIt could well be that the ethnic Serbs in Kosovo will eventually join Serbia as part of a\\nfinal settlement that will see Belgrade recognising Kosovan independence. Whether\\nKosovo then seeks to be part of a larger Albania is not yet on the agenda but it might be at\\nsome stage. What seems most likely is that Serbia and Albania will both end up as\\nmembers of the EU and the resulting economic interdependence between the two might\\nwell lead to the evolution of a more peaceful solution, whether that involves a sovereign\\nKosovan state or not.\\n \\nThe four Yugoslav civil wars of the 1990s became the subject of various judicial hearings\\ninto war crimes held under a specially constituted UN court, the International Criminal\\nTribunal for the \\nformer Yugoslavia (or ICTY). It met in the Dutch city of The Hague, the seat\\nof the International Criminal Court, and was also known as the Hague War Crimes\\nTribunal. A string of guilty verdicts early on suggested the tribunal was sending out tough\\nsignals about what was acceptable in the theatre of war, but a run of not-guilty verdicts on\\ntechnicalities in recent years has cast doubt on how strong the signals will prove in the\\nlong term. The tribunal was supposed to have concluded all its work by the end of 2014 but\\nthe late captures of Mladic and Hadzic mean it will probably not wrap up until 2016 or\\n2017.\\nThe tribunal’s most eye-catching conclusion was that some of the atrocities did\\nconstitute genocide. Genocide was defined in the 1948 Genocide Convention (UN\\nGeneral Assembly resolution 260) as an act ‘committed with intent to destroy, in whole or\\nin part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group’ but, until the Yugoslav war-crimes\\ntribunal, no state had ever been found to be in breach of the convention. The ICTY found\\nSerbia not guilty of direct involvement in genocide, but it did become the first country to be\\ncriticised for a breach of international law by failing to prevent the genocide committed in\\nSrebrenica in 1995. The tribunal indicted 161 persons under the Genocide Convention\\nand convicted 69 of them for genocide or lesser war crimes. But the most high-profile\\ndefendant, Slobodan Milosevic, escaped justice when he was found dead in his cell in\\n2006. The assumption has been that he took his life but no definitive cause of death has\\never been proven. Whether suicide, sudden illness or murder, his death robbed the world\\nof a verdict in a rare trial of a head of state for atrocities committed under his rule.\\nThroughout the period in which the tribunal did its work, Serbia and the other former\\nYugoslav nations rebuilt their badly damaged countries. In 2003 Serbia and Montenegro\\ndropped the pretence of being Yugoslavia and called themselves ‘Serbia & Montenegro’ in\\na \\nthree-year deal that would culminate in a Montenegrin referendum on independence. In\\n2006 the Montenegrins narrowly voted for it, thereby ending the break-up of Yugoslavia\\nthat had started in 1991 and taken 15 bloody years. In that time, more than 140,000 people\\nare believed to have lost their lives in the wars, based on estimates by international',\n",
       " 'humanitarian agencies.\\nThere’s no doubt that Serbia emerged from the break-up of Yugoslavia with the lion’s\\nshare of the blame. The belligerent figure of Slobodan Milosevic probably has a lot to do\\nwith that, and a 1994 UN report said Serbia was trying to create a Greater Serbia, rather\\nthan trying to restore Yugoslavia. The war-crimes tribunal also said the majority of the\\ncasualties were victims of Serbian aggression, and there are accounts that Serbs who\\nargued for a tempering of Serbian nationalism were often harassed, hounded and even\\nkilled. Yet is it really fair to tag the Serbs as the only villains, even if statistics suggest they\\nwere the biggest culprits in the four wars? Croatia’s nationalism too was always\\n‘exclusive’, there are plenty of tales of the Muslim community of Bosnia whipping itself into\\na frenzy, and while the Muslims and Croats did indeed suffer in Bosnia at the hands of\\nSerb nationalists, in the 1941–45 civil war it had been largely the Serbs who had suffered\\nat the hands of the brutal Croatian fascists, the Ustase, and, to a lesser extent, the Muslim\\nBosnians. It makes it understandable but still tragically unnecessary. It would be wrong to\\nspend too much time in this book on the question of blame, yet it is fair to say that a view of\\nthe Yugoslav wars that says it was all down to Serbian aggression, and that the Croats,\\nBosnians and others were innocent victims, is oversimplistic in the extreme.\\nIt’s also important to remember that there were many in the old Yugoslavia who had no\\ntruck with the inter-nation belligerence. Symbolically, a march in Sarajevo in March 1992\\nunited Bosnians, Serbs and Croats in opposing inter-ethnic conflict, but it ended \\nwhen\\nshots were fired from Serb positions, and Sarajevo’s first fatality was a student\\ndemonstrating for peace in that march. Such voices for peace were seldom heard.\\n \\nIt’s easy to see the Yugoslav civil wars of the 1990s as the build-up of inter-ethnic hatred\\nover many decades but that isn’t, on its own, a satisfying explanation. The ethnic and\\nreligious differences between most of the nations that made up Yugoslavia were, if\\nanything, much less pronounced than the differences among some of the German-\\nspeaking states that made up Germany from 1871 and continue to make up the country\\ntoday. Faced with joint threats in the 1920s and 1940s, the Yugoslav states were happy to\\ncome together, first as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, then as Yugoslavia\\nunder Tito, to fashion a state that defied international threats and did rather well out of both\\nMoscow and Washington. But once Tito had gone and Moscow’s influence was on the\\nwane, there was no longer an external threat to hold the various states together. And\\nperhaps the fact that they had been held together pretty much from 1918 to 1990 – largely\\nby Tito’s charisma and without the crimes of the civil war of 1941–45 being fully worked\\nthrough – meant conditions were rife for resentments to grow to the point where they\\ncreated a powder keg just waiting to be lit.\\nArguably the biggest tragedy is that Serb nationalism grew to the point where anyone\\nwho was not Serbian was relegated to second-class citizenship and ethnic cleansing was\\nconsidered (by some) a legitimate means of establishing the Serbian state. The idea that\\nSerbia had an ‘inclusive’ ideology in the 1850s and 1920s, viewing Croats, Montenegrins\\nand Macedonians as people who could live peacefully in the same country as Serbs, may\\nbe a little too benign as an interpretation of original Serb nationalism. The Nacertanije\\ndocument of 1844, which acted as a blueprint for the establishment of a sovereign Greater\\nSerbian state, talked of including Montenegro, Bosnia, \\nHerzegovina and northern Albania\\nin the new Serbia, and there are those who believe Serbian nationalists came to see the\\n1918 kingdom as a construct that they could dominate and, therefore, as a vehicle for\\nachieving Greater Serbia by the back door. But the fact that the Serbs worked moderately',\n",
       " 'successfully with their five fellow Yugoslav states up to 1990, plus the closeness of\\nSerbian language and culture to that of many of Serbia’s neighbours, suggests that an\\nentrenched ‘them and us’ attitude towards national identity is not helpful today. One hopes\\nthat Serbia’s application to join the European Union means ‘inclusiveness’ is back, if only\\nbecause Serbia’s economic well-being depends on it.\\nSo Serbia went into the 21st century restored as a sovereign state but needing to\\nundertake a massive exercise in rehabilitation. What Germany, Italy and Japan had faced\\nafter the Second World War, South Africa after apartheid, and Argentina after its era of\\nruthless military junta, Serbia faced after its bloody emergence from Yugoslavia. In this\\ncontext, if you had to draw up the ideal ambassador to represent the still-new Serbian state\\non the global stage, it would probably be a passionate Serb of mixed-nation parentage\\nwho both connects with his people and has the intellect and sensitivity to understand the\\nreservations harboured by an international community still in shock from the images of\\nSerbian brutality it saw on its television screens throughout the 1990s.

       " 'CHAPTER FIVE\\nTOUGHENED BY NATO’S BOMBS\\nI\\nt’s hard for a generation of people who have not known the hardship of war to hear the\\ntales of those who went through it. Those born in Europe after 1945 will have had to listen\\nto the stories of parents and grandparents telling them how they survived the fear and\\nprivations of the two world wars, the people they knew dying around them, the uncertainty\\nof not knowing who would be next – stories often told with a subliminal admonishing\\nmessage of ‘You don’t know how lucky you are’.\\nWhat distinguishes Novak Djokovic from Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray\\nand many of their contemporaries is that Djokovic does know. He was 11 when Nato\\nplanes started bombing Belgrade and he spent his 12th birthday with the bombing in full\\nswing. It didn’t stop him playing tennis, although each new day often meant a different\\ncourt. But spending many of the 76 nights of the bombing in a cellar robbed him of sleep,\\nas well as allowing him to share the collective fear of the whole city and, specifically, \\nthe\\npeople he and his brothers shared the cellar with. It’s he who will be boring his children\\nand grandchildren with tales of how he survived the war.\\nWhen the bombing began, the family was together in Belgrade after the winter season in\\nKopaonik. They spent much of the time in Grandfather Vlada’s two-bedroom flat, not\\nbecause it was a spacious place to be but because it had a basement storage area where\\nthe family could flee to whenever the sirens started.\\nIn late 2011 Djokovic allowed a camera team from the American television company\\nCBS to come with him and Vlada and visit the cellar where they spent many nights during\\nthe bombing, including every night of the first two weeks. Even today, the basement is\\nstark, lightless concrete. Modern warfare meant that, when the siren went, they had to go\\nstraight down to the cellar – there was no time to prepare as there had been during the\\nSecond World War – and there was no limit on the number of people allowed into the\\ncramped space. Watching him on camera in the cellar, it’s clear he has retained the child’s\\nability to be factual about it and not to impose on to his memory the feelings that come with\\nadult awareness. It’s just what happened, and if there’s any emotion attached to it, it’s the\\nschoolboy’s satisfaction of not having to go to school.\\nDjokovic was asked by the CBS interviewer Bob Simon whether he lost his focus. ‘The\\nfirst couple of weeks I did,’ he replied. ‘We were waking up every single night more or less\\nat two or three in the morning for two and a half months because of the bombing. But I try to\\nremember those days in a very bright, positive way. We didn’t need to go to school and I\\nplayed more tennis. It made us tougher, made us more hungry for success.’\\nHis coach Jelena Gencic, who had lived through the German and British bombings of\\nher country and had hoped never to experience another, tried to keep up his tennis\\neducation in spite of the carnage and chaos. Because she was a leading figure in the\\nSerbian tennis \\nworld, she could turn up at courts and they would let her play, so she was\\nconstantly looking for safe courts. ‘One morning I called him,’ she said, ‘and I said there’s a\\nmilitary hospital across the road from the tennis courts, so I said they probably wouldn’t\\nbomb the hospital, especially as all around it had been bombed. They went for a different\\nbombing target every night, so when a place was bombed, it seemed safe after that to\\npractise there. One day I made a mistake: they bombed the area where we had just been',\n",
       " 'playing. We changed clubs constantly. Once we thought of practising at a club on the other\\nside of the Danube but we didn’t because we thought the bridge might be bombed and we\\nwouldn’t get back. We were all very afraid and we had very little food, so we were hungry\\nand Novak often had to practise without having eaten enough.’\\nAna Ivanovic, a contemporary of Djokovic who had visited the Djokovic restaurant in\\nKopaonik when she was four (her father and Djokovic’s uncle Goran were at school\\ntogether), tells a similar story:\\nIt was a very tough period, not only for us as kids but for our country in general. The\\n1990s were very hard anyway, the economy wasn’t great and I remember the bombing\\nstarting on 24 March – it was actually my cousin’s birthday, so she was very sad\\nbecause she couldn’t celebrate it as everyone was going into the shelters. For the first\\nfew weeks we didn’t practise because we didn’t know what to expect, so we’d stay at\\nhome, but later on, when the danger was not there, when the sirens were off, that’s\\nwhen we started practising. Most of the time it was six to eight in the morning, or\\nmaybe seven to nine. We’d try to live as normal as possible. I remember towards the\\nend that they had an under-12s tournament and they even had a rule that, if the\\nmatches were on and the sirens came on, the match had to be finished but no new\\nmatches were called to start! I never played a match when the siren went off but I was\\nthere once when it went off.\\nIvanovic also tells the story of her and Djokovic having fun at tournaments around that time.\\n‘We shared lot of fun moments,’ she says. ‘We played lots of tournaments, under-10s,\\nunder-12s, in Serbia. We used to play hide and seek. You play two, three matches a day.\\nIn between you have nothing to do, so you play games.’ Without ever having been an item,\\nDjokovic and Ivanovic are very close – they are clearly very fond of each other and many\\nwho know them suggest Djokovic holds something of a candle for Ivanovic but not to an\\nextent that has ever threatened his relationship with his fiancée Jelena Ristic. It may be\\nmore of the shared history of both Kapaonik and surviving the bombing that creates a\\n‘bunker’ solidarity and thus transcends any conventional idea of friendship, sexual or\\notherwise.\\nThe Serbian coach and Davis Cup captain Bogdan Obradovic remembers that\\nlunchtimes, rather than early mornings, were the safest time to practise during the\\nbombing. He says he did most of his coaching between noon and 2 pm ‘because nothing\\nreally happened then’. The time is almost immaterial – the fact is they were constantly\\nadjusting their life and practice courts to keep clear of the best aircraft Nato had at its\\ndisposal.\\nThe impression someone from western Europe could get from such tales is that there\\nwas a string of tennis clubs dotted around Belgrade, but that would be a slightly misleading\\npicture. There were several courts but many of them were in a very modest state of repair.\\nTennis had never been particularly big in Yugoslavia and this was a time when the\\nSerbian economy was in a particularly parlous state. Often, it was a case of making a court\\nout of any available space. The most notorious example was the court at the Jedanaesti\\nApril club (the ‘11 April’ club) where Ivanovic and Janko Tipsarevic \\nplayed. The club had\\nan Olympic-sized swimming pool but it was too expensive to maintain, especially when\\npeople weren’t into swimming. So the pool was emptied, a carpet put in it and a singles\\ncourt was marked out – there wasn’t enough room for a doubles court. These days it’s a\\npool again and it has proper courts where Tipsarevic runs his academy. But that illustrates\\nthe lack of facilities available to budding tennis players in Serbia throughout the 1990s.',\n",
       " 'In a rare interview, Dijana Djokovic told the \\nGuardian\\n newspaper in January 2008 that it\\nwas Djokovic’s tennis routine that saw the family through the Nato bombing. ‘All our family\\nwere here in Belgrade during the bombing and all day we were on court,’ she said. ‘And\\nthis is what saved us. It wasn’t any more or less safe than any other place in the street, but\\nif you’re sitting at home in the basement, thinking they are going to bomb your home,\\nyou’re going crazy. It’s not good. We were practising all day and at seven o’clock we would\\ngo home and sit with the curtains closed, everything closed and dark the way it had to be.’\\nAna Ivanovic echoes this philosophical approach to the threat:\\nWe were underground for the first night and then my parents said, ‘You know what? If\\nit’s going to hit, it’s going to happen,’ so we just stayed at ground level. We had a two-\\nfloor house, so we just took the back room and that’s where we basically lived. Once\\nwe got into the bombing, people would say they had an idea of where would be\\nbombed that day – they said it was targeted but we never really knew. A few times we\\nheard really loud explosions and it’s not the best feeling. For me, it wasn’t about\\nmissing school, it was that everyone was together. As a kid, I never wanted to sleep\\non my own, so during the bombing we all slept in the same room, so for me, that was\\nparadise – my parents and my brother, we all stayed in one room. We always had\\ngrandparents and other people coming over to stay, we were always hanging out, so I\\nwas never on my own, which was perfect. There was one very scary moment. We\\nused to live across from this large post office and one night they came and said this\\nwould probably be bombed that night. This was 10 o’clock in the evening and we\\nwere ready for bed, so my parents said, ‘Right, we’re going to go to [your]\\ngrandparents,’ who lived about 10 minutes away. So we took a car, we drove there\\nand we had to pass by a really tall building, which was about 500 metres as the crow\\nflies from where my grandparents lived and, literally 15 minutes later, there was a\\nhuge explosion – they’d bombed the tall building, the building we’d driven past 20\\nminutes earlier. That was the worst moment. As a kid, your parents tried to protect you\\na little bit. I remember one time sitting in the living room and a plane went through the\\nsound barrier, and there was a very loud noise like an explosion. And I said to my dad,\\n‘Oh my God, what was that?’ and he said, ‘Oh, nothing, a truck fell in a hole in the\\nstreet.’ These kind of things – they try to protect you and it’s only later that you realise\\nthat was actually quite scary.\\nDjokovic himself has talked of that time as ‘the period that nobody in our country likes to\\nremember’ but he goes further. ‘It is a very powerful memory from my childhood that really\\nshaped my character,’ he says. ‘It was a devastating and helpless time for my country;\\nthose three months of not knowing who and what is next, and you have nowhere to hide for\\nreal. Many innocent people died, a lot of infrastructure was destroyed and even now is still\\nin ruins… It takes time for a country to recover after such a big destructive force. We were\\nat first hiding at the basement thinking we would be safe there, but the reality is that even\\nsome people hiding in basements were dying when the bombs crashed, so there was no\\npoint. So, after those first few weeks of panic and disbelief, we went \\nback to standard\\nroutines, even though the bombs were still falling all over. My family was at first all\\ntogether, but then each of us went back to our duties. My parents went to Kopaonik to work,\\nI went back on court to practise.’\\nLike Ivanovic’s cousin, Djokovic was unable to do much celebrating when his 12th\\nbirthday arrived on 22 May 1999. ‘I celebrated on court, like every other birthday,’ he says\\nwith a smile, ‘except that by then there were no more bombs flying over my head, only',\n",
       " 'fireworks.’\\nDuring the 2013 US Open, Djokovic ventured a very strong opinion on whether the US\\ngovernment should support air strikes against Syria, whose government was suspected of\\nusing chemical weapons against its citizens. His vehement reaction (see page 249) stems\\ndirectly from the lessons he learned from the Nato bombing of Belgrade. But when it was\\nhappening, when the 11-year-old boy was playing tennis by day and dodging the bombs\\nby night, did he realise why it was happening? He is very clear about this. ‘That is the first\\nthing everybody asks when things go wrong, and something bad happens. Why me? Why\\nus? I did ask and got a very simple answer: \\nBecause they can\\n. And that was the truth. Now\\nas a grown person, I can always give you a straight answer: there is no valid justification\\nfor any act of violence that for a consequence has the death of many people. What answer\\ncan justify the fact that many children died, many families were torn apart, many cities\\ndestroyed, many left sick? No war is good and thank God many people are now fighting\\nagainst it.’\\nThis is powerful stuff. His ‘because they can’ appears to strip bare the morality of the\\nforeign policy of countries in the developed world. Although he doesn’t use these words,\\nhis statement could be read as implying that there are all sorts of injustices in the world\\nand no shortage of despotic regimes, yet the countries either side of the North Atlantic\\nchoose which of them to attack and which to \\nleave well alone on the basis of feasibility. As\\na \\ncri de coeur\\n from the developing world, it is very resonant, whether one agrees with it or\\nnot.\\n \\nThe bombing clearly didn’t help, but the 1990s were hardly a propitious time for budding\\ntennis players in Serbia anyway. With war going on from 1991 to 1995 and then again\\n1998–99, and economic sanctions to boot, the Serbian economy was in no position to\\nrecover and, with Slobodan Milosevic’s state-controlled economic policies still in place,\\nthere was little incentive or possibility for foreign firms to invest in Serbia. That meant it was\\nvery hard to finance a professional tennis career.\\nDusan Vemic was born in 1976. He turned professional at 16, just as the wars were\\nreaching their height, and he struggled to find both sponsorship and the help he needed.\\nHe says,\\nCompanies didn’t have money for sponsorship and we needed to get a visa for every\\ncountry – we’d spend whole mornings standing in line for a visa, not knowing if we’d\\nget it. We skipped one or two European championships because they were in\\nSwitzerland and we couldn’t get a visa in time. The federation was extremely poor, so\\nwe had to do a lot ourselves. Fortunately, there were some satellite tournaments in\\nSerbia and nearby, so we could play a few tournaments. We were fighting for our\\nlivelihoods so we appreciated any help we’d get from anyone but it wasn’t much. In\\nSerbia we had no great players except Bobo [Zivojinovic] and he was a businessman\\nat that time so not able to do much for us. We didn’t have enough coaching, we didn’t\\ndo enough fitness work – I can’t say whether that would have made a massive\\ndifference to our results but it would have helped us if we’d had proper coaching.\\nVemic can thank tennis for taking him out of Belgrade during the bombing – he left the day\\nbefore it started to play a handful of Challenger tournaments in the USA but it was hardly\\ngood for his peace of mind. ‘As I arrived, I saw Belgrade on fire on the TV. It didn’t exactly\\nfeel great. I tried calling home to my parents in Belgrade but I couldn’t get through for a few\\ndays. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone – not knowing what’s going on [with] your loved ones',\n",
       " 'back home. Somehow, I’m able to use sport as my escape from reality, I was able to be in\\nthe moment playing but it wasn’t a nice experience, even if it gave me a bit more of a spark.\\nI was probably luckier than many of my friends who were back home.’\\nIt was against this background that Srdjan Djokovic was having to find money for\\nNovak’s tennis. Plenty of top-level athletes and artists have come from unlikely places but\\nthere was normally some money there. There was no obvious funding stream for Djokovic.\\nThere are different views as to how much money the family actually had at its disposal.\\nThe Djokovics did have two restaurants that were doing reasonably well, which is enough\\nto feed one line of thinking that questions the ‘boy from modest surroundings’ line. In\\nfairness, Srdjan has never claimed the family were poor; he said they always had enough\\nto live but that didn’t leave much over for additional expenses like coaching and travelling\\nto tournaments. Indeed, as the head of a family with three children, it would have been\\nirresponsible if he had thrown everything into one child’s potential career. And he had to\\nbe patient and beware the risk of teenage burnout. The tennis wayside is littered with the\\ntales of children whose parents thought their playing ability was the key to untold riches\\nthat would benefit the entire family – many such children burned out, if only because they\\ncouldn’t handle being the family’s cash cow.\\nSo when Srdjan tells the stories of having knives held to his throat \\nand dealing with loan\\nsharks charging massive rates of interest, it’s very easy to believe him.\\nIt also raises the question of whether the tennis careers of Marko and Djordje were\\nsacrificed because finding the cash for one player was putting the family at full strain. In a\\nrare television interview, Srdjan said of his second and third sons, ‘I tried to discourage\\nthem but to no avail. Their own brother is the greatest idol to them. They don’t have to look\\nelsewhere. I am convinced they are going to be good tennis players. How good I don’t\\nknow but they’re trying hard and want to be like Novak.’ Jelena Gencic backed this up,\\nnoting that ‘Djordje was very good but Srdjan told me he didn’t want to have two or even\\nthree tennis professionals playing in his house – for him, Novak was enough. He didn’t\\nstop me working with Marko and Djordje but he told me not to make them the best. I said it\\nwas probably too late anyway.’ And Dejan Petrovic, who coached Djokovic for 10 months\\nin 2004–5, says, ‘Djordje has a lot of the same qualities as Nole’ without ever having the\\nfull package his elder brother has. The general feeling among tennis observers is that\\nMarko would never have made it as a touring professional but Djordje might have done.\\nGencic, Petrovic and others never believed Djordje was in Novak’s league but then there\\nare many players who could make a good living from tennis without ever coming close to\\nthat.\\nGencic also made one observation that suggests that Djokovic was sensitive to the role\\nmoney played in the family. She recalled that\\nWhen Novak started to be famous, Grandfather Vlada came to watch and Novak\\nasked me if I’d seen him. I told him where he was and, when he found him, he asked\\nhis grandfather to lend him some money. Novak knew that Vlada didn’t have much\\nmoney and Novak did – he was in the world’s top 20 by then – but Novak recognised\\nthat it was very important for both of them for him to ask to borrow money, to show\\nwhat an important person his grandfather was. It was a matter of pride for his\\ngrandfather to be able to lend him some money. The next day Novak gave me the\\nmoney to give back to his grandfather, which was always going to happen, but he’d\\ngiven him the satisfaction of being able to offer him the sum. Novak was sensitive to\\nthat.',\n",
       " 'The issue of money never fully resolved itself until Djokovic was 16 and a deal was struck\\nwith a management company that brought a guaranteed income into the Djokovic coffers\\n(see page 83).\\n \\nThe period from age 12 to 14 is the time when Jelena Gencic started to relinquish control\\nof Djokovic, but it was a gradual process and it doesn’t lend itself to a neat chronology. A\\nfeature of this time is that there are a number of people who worked to a greater or lesser\\nextent with the young Djokovic, some overlapping. Most of them – understandably – claim\\ntheir slice of the Djokovic cake. Perhaps this is heightened by the fact that the Djokovic\\nfamily doesn’t always rush to acknowledge the help they received from these coaches –\\nsometimes all people want is recognition yet sometimes that recognition is very hard to\\ngive.\\nGencic and others around Djokovic felt he needed a more competitive tennis\\nenvironment if he was to continue his progress to the top. Gencic said,\\nIn the morning he did his technical practice but in the afternoon I felt he needed a\\npractice match over three sets, four afternoons a week. He was about 11 or 12 at this\\nstage and I couldn’t find players who wanted to play with him. I asked boys a couple of\\nyears older but, if they lost the first set, they said, ‘I have to do my homework,’ or some\\nexcuse because they didn’t want to lose against this little boy. So I said he could play\\nwith older players with ratings and at the beginning it was good because everyone\\nwanted to play with the little boy, the older ones didn’t mind. But he then beat all the\\nolder ones too. So I said to Srdjan and Dijana, ‘We must send him somewhere where\\nhe has sparring partners.’\\nThe obvious place to go was America but Gencic urged them not to send him there. She\\nrecognised that he was a very family-orientated boy who couldn’t be away from his mother\\nand brothers for too long; that the closeness of the family was central to his personal\\nsecurity. At the time, Spain was emerging as the leading European country for tennis\\ncoaching, largely because in much of the country you can play outdoors for most of the\\nyear, and the Sanchez-Casal academy in Barcelona had created a worldwide reputation\\nfor itself (Andy Murray was later to spend two years there). But the wish was for\\nsomewhere even closer to home.\\nGencic hit on the idea of Nikki Pilic, the controversial Yugoslav left-hander whose\\nrefusal to play a Davis Cup tie in 1973 because of a professional commitment had\\nunleashed the furore that led to 81 male professionals boycotting Wimbledon that year.\\nJust three years younger than Gencic, the two had played on the circuit together. He had\\nlater moved to Germany and had set up an academy in Munich, which specialised in\\nplayers aged 13 and over who were looking to make the transition from junior tennis to the\\nfull pro tour.\\n‘So I called him,’ Gencic recalled, ‘and said, “Niko, I have a very good young player.\\nHe’s 12. Can I send him to you?” He said, “Oh no, Jelena, you know I’m not working with\\nplayers that young.” I said, “Please, only one week, just one. Have a look at him, and if you\\ndon’t want to work with him, he’ll come back to me and you \\ncan give me one or two\\nsuggestions as to how I can help him. But please remember, they don’t have money. He\\nwill return your money for the camp because I’m sure he’ll be the best one day.” He sighed\\nand said, “Oh, Jelena, Jelena – all right, send him.”’\\nA week after Djokovic had arrived at Pilic’s academy, he called Gencic and said,\\n‘Jelena, why didn’t you send this boy earlier to me?’ Gencic said she answered, ‘Oh, Niko,',\n",
       " 'if I’d sent him earlier, you’d have said, “I’ve discovered and made this great champion!” and\\nI didn’t want that to happen.’\\nPilic’s version of that story is, perhaps not surprisingly, slightly different. He says of\\nGencic,\\nShe had been asking me for some time but I told her we should wait a bit. So Novak\\ndidn’t come to me until he was 12 years and 10 months. He came with his uncle\\nGoran and I didn’t think much at first. I saw that he had a little bit wrong with his game.\\nHe had wrong grips – he had an extreme western grip and his backhand grip was also\\nextreme. He was moving OK, his coordination was OK, his serve was OK but nothing\\nspecial and he didn’t volley much. I had to show him what I wanted to see on the\\nforehand and backhand and, for a guy with that coordination and such fine motor\\nskills, and good eyes and good legs, he picked it up very quickly. We also played\\nsoccer and he was very good at that.\\nIt would be easy to conclude from this account that Gencic’s coaching was not all it was\\ncracked up to be, that Djokovic was a talent when he went to Munich but very much a\\nrough diamond in need of a lot of polishing. While broadly true, that would be a slightly\\nunfair interpretation. The technique taught to youngsters aged 5–12 is frequently different\\nin subtle ways to that taught when they have teenage growth spurts. In addition, Pilic\\nadmits that he’s \\nnaturally cautious on first viewing: ‘I’m not that impressed with anyone at\\nthe beginning,’ he says. ‘There are thousands of people who play great tennis but they\\ndon’t make it because they don’t have character, they don’t have mental strength, they\\ndon’t have the will to win. There are lots of components to really winning. But I think\\nnobody could be that impressed [with Djokovic] because he didn’t have great technique.’ Is\\nthere, perhaps, also that universal element that makes it easy for any specialist to believe\\ntheir first job is to undo the work of the last specialist?\\nYet even the hard-to-impress Pilic realised after about four months that he had someone\\na bit special on his hands. Pilic’s wife Mija is Serbian, so she often got Novak into\\nconversation, especially in the early visits when Djokovic lived with the Pilics (only when\\nhe moved to Pilic’s academy full-time did he live in separate accommodation). And it was\\nas much in conversation as on the tennis court that Pilic realised that the boy had\\n‘incredible focus’. Pilic says, ‘He was very professional and always early for training. I\\nremember arranging to hit with him at two o’clock and, 20 minutes before two, my wife saw\\nhim and asked him where he was going. He said he was going to warm up and she said,\\n“That’s very good,” to which he replied, “I don’t want to risk my career!” This at 13 years\\nand two months.’\\nDjokovic paid several visits to Munich for the first couple of years, before basing himself\\npermanently there. That meant he was coached by Pilic part of the time but also had\\ncoaches in Belgrade.\\nOne of them was Bogdan Obradovic, who was based at the Partizan club in Belgrade\\nwhen he wasn’t travelling with Nenad Zimonjic. With Gencic also based at Partizan,\\nObradovic got to see Djokovic for the first time in 1997, when Djokovic was 10. ‘He was so\\nprofessional,’ Obradovic recalls. ‘You didn’t need to say anything to him about preparing\\nfor tennis – he got there early, did his warming up, his running, a total professional at 10.’\\nObradovic \\nliaised closely with Pilic, which gave a degree of continuity to Djokovic’s tennis\\neducation, especially as Obradovic also recognised the need to make adjustments to the\\nboy’s technique.\\nObradovic coached Djokovic to his first international title, the Under-14 European',\n",
       " 'Individual Championships in San Remo. While there, Djokovic was interviewed by an\\nItalian tennis magazine, which asked him who his coach was. He could have replied\\nJelena Gencic, as she was very much still on the scene, but he replied Bogdan Obradovic\\nand later proudly showed Obradovic the article in which the quote was faithfully reported.\\nIn April 2000, just as the Milosevic regime was on the wane, an industrialist Djordjo\\nAntelj founded a tennis club about 500 metres from the Marakana football stadium called\\nTK Gemax (sometimes written Gemaks). Gemax was a construction company that had built\\nroads and buildings, and Antelj had become one of Serbia’s richest men. He was also big\\ninto tennis, so founding a club was both a business proposition and a hobby. More than\\nthat, he offered financial support to all the Davis Cup and Fed Cup players with free winter\\ncourt hire, and this extended to supporting all the Serbian players that were any good, or\\nmight be in the future.\\nBarely a year after establishing the club, Antelj identified three 14-year-old boys he\\nwanted to sponsor: Branko Kusmanovic, Bojan Bozovic and Novak Djokovic. That same\\nyear (2001), Ladislav Kis, a Serbian-born player who had emigrated to Australia at 15,\\nreturned to Serbia as coach of the country’s top woman player, Dragana Zaric. But as she\\nwas struggling for funding after failing to break the top 150 by the age of 24, Antelj\\napproached Kis and asked if he wanted to coach the three boys. More importantly, he\\noffered Djokovic a deal that effectively made Kis his coach. Bozovic had his own private\\ncoach (with whom Djokovic had been working informally) so, effectively, the Gemax club\\nbegan funding Kis to coach Kusmanovic and Djokovic.\\nKis says Djokovic approached him on their first session and said, ‘You’ve just lived 10\\nyears in Australia, right? I really want you to coach me in English.’ When Kis asked why,\\ngiven that Serbian was the mother tongue for both of them, Djokovic replied, ‘Well, I’m\\ngoing to need English when I’m No. 1, I’ll have to do all my interviews and press\\nconferences in English, so it’s good if I practise my English now.’ Even today, when\\nDjokovic runs into Kis, he will greet his former coach with, ‘G’day, mate!’ out of affection for\\nKis’s Australian twang.\\n‘It’s every coach’s dream to work with a player like that,’ says Kis.\\nHe was such a good student. You could even tell him to do something wrong and he\\nwould do it so well that the wrong might turn into a right – he was that capable. And his\\nconfidence and self-belief were amazing; no matter what you asked him to do, he\\nwould do it. He was so focused. Once he had a shoulder problem and the physio\\nasked him to put his finger in his belly button, just to open up the shoulder muscles.\\nAfter about 10 minutes the physio started working on Novak’s legs but Novak kept his\\nfinger in his belly button. Eventually, the physio asked him why his finger was still in\\nhis belly button, to which Novak replied that the physio had asked him to put it there\\nand hadn’t told him to take it out! Whatever I asked him, he did to perfection. I used the\\nold ‘suicide drills’ to see how tough a kid is – you get a basket of balls and move him\\nleft and right, front and back, until he gives up. We’d need Srdjan at the back picking\\nup balls and throwing them back into the basket because Novak would always go\\nmore than a hundred balls – this at the age of 14. As a coach, you need to monitor that\\nhis legs aren’t collapsing because there’s a risk of injury if you let them go on too long,\\nbut no, this kid just went on and on and on. After about 120 balls, he’d throw his racket\\naside and say, ‘I’m done,’ which was good because I was close to telling him to stop.\\nThat’s what you see these days with his ability to run and run.\\nKis was also taken by Djokovic as a person: ‘He was fantastic, and he still is, even if these',\n",
       " 'days he’s torn between a million people who all want a piece of him. I was 24 at the time\\nand I wasn’t totally aware then that I had a future world No. 1 on my hands. I think I got the\\nopportunity to work with him because I was a new face at Gemax, so I was lucky enough to\\nget the honour of coaching him. He was a gift, he’s a gift to any coach because, to be\\nhonest, he’d be this good whoever was coaching him.’\\nThe story of how Kis’s coaching relationship with Djokovic came to an end is told on\\npages 94–6 but the six months they spent together offered Djokovic a degree of stability\\nwhen he was starting to make his way on the international junior circuit. When it ended in\\nearly 2002, Djokovic spent the rest of the winter playing at the Partizan club under the eye\\nof Bogdan Obradovic, before moving to Munich full time.\\nPilic noted the same massive willingness to learn that Gencic and Kis had picked up.\\nDjokovic constantly asked Pilic questions about tennis, in particular about the top players\\nPilic had worked with – Boris Becker, Michael Stich, Goran Ivanisevic and others. In\\nNovember 2000 Ivanisevic came to Munich in a terrible state – he had lost 13 first rounds\\nthat year and had ended his tournament schedule with the embarrassment of defaulting in\\na match in Brighton after running out of rackets in the final set against the Korean Hyung\\nTaik Lee. Pilic told Ivanisevic he had a kid who would be ‘at least top five’ and told him to\\n‘hit with this boy for a few minutes’. They hit for half an hour and Djokovic didn’t hit one ball\\ninto the net. Pilic says Ivanisevic was hypnotised and Ivanisevic himself admits he was\\nseriously impressed. ‘I hit half an hour with \\nhim,’ he says, ‘and you could see he was\\ntalented, he had that something that he needs to be where he is now. You couldn’t say if\\nhe was going to be one, five, 10, 15, but you could see his potential.’\\nPilic’s wider contacts in the tennis world meant others got to see the promising Serbian\\nboy. One was Ivan Ljubicic, the cerebral Croatian player who worked with Pilic when Pilic\\nbecame Croatia’s Davis Cup captain. ‘Nikki is unbelievable in reading the potential of\\nplayers,’ Ljubicic says, ‘and he said he was definitely going to be top class. He was\\nmentally ready for it from the beginning.’\\nIt wasn’t until July 2001 that Pilic began to be seriously impressed. Just two months after\\nhis 14th birthday, Djokovic won the 14 & Under singles and doubles titles at the European\\nJunior Championships. That was when Pilic first got the sense that the lad Gencic had sent\\nto him might be a world-beater. ‘I could see he was already playing at a very high level –\\nhe needed to improve his serve and use his volleys more but from the back he was very\\nstrong. I used to hit with him myself, I knew how good he was from his reactions, from how\\nhe sees the ball, how he reacted to drop shots – you can see all those things. He was very\\ncoachable, a good worker and had in his head where he wanted to go. He was very\\nprofessional in all respects.’\\n \\nDjokovic was based at the Pilic academy for almost four years – two years part time, two\\nyears full time. Gencic’s assessment that Novak should never be too far from his family\\nmeant he often returned to Belgrade, even if it put a further strain on the family’s fragile\\nfinances. ‘When Novak came back to Belgrade,’ Gencic said, ‘we’d work at Partizan, or\\nhe’d play some matches at Gemax and then, after three or four days, I’d ask him whether\\nhe felt able to go back to Belgrade and he’d generally say yes.’ The trips back to Belgrade\\nallowed him to catch up with his school friends, many of whom remain his friends today, as\\nthey offer him an escape from the tennis world.\\nOne of his closest tennis friends during his early teens was Bojan Bozovic. ‘We became\\nbest friends because we spent the whole time together,’ says Bozovic from his home in\\nZurich, where he now runs a tennis academy but remains in regular contact with Djokovic.',\n",
       " 'The two boys were not just friends but also doubles partners, winning the European\\ndoubles gold medal at under-14 and under-16 level. So what was Djokovic like as an early\\nteenager? Bozovic says,\\nI could see that his only wish was to be No. 1 and he sacrificed everything for that\\ngoal. He didn’t want to do anything else, only to be the best. You could see that he\\nonly had tennis on his mind. He had one goal and everything he did was directed at\\nachieving that goal. I remember when he won the singles at the European\\nChampionships, we were given 10 days off afterwards but he was still going to bed at\\n9.30 or 10 o’clock. Everyone else went for a walk or went for an ice cream but Novak\\nwent to bed no later than 10 because he didn’t want to lose the rhythm. At 14 he was\\npractising six hours a day. He had no time for other stuff, although he did like football\\nand skiing. He hasn’t really changed from then to now; he’s stayed the same. He\\nalways had great charisma. I don’t care that he’s No. 1. He’s my friend and I have a lot\\nof trust in him.\\nOne figure who played a more prominent role in the rise of Serbian tennis than is widely\\nappreciated is Nenad Zimonjic. These days, the studious-looking Zimonjic with his greying\\ngoatee beard is thought of largely as an ageing doubles specialist, but he is in some ways\\nthe quiet godfather of Serbia’s tennis golden age. And his role in the Djokovic story began\\naround this time.\\nBorn in 1976, Zimonjic broke into the world’s top 200 in singles at the end of 1998 and\\nthe top 100 in doubles a couple of months later. In 1999 he reached the third round of the\\nWimbledon singles. \\nAmid the dearth of Serbian talent in the post-Zivojinovic and post-\\nbreak-up era, he was the shining light. Although a man of great, if softly spoken, self-\\nconfidence, he was never going to set the tennis world alight, but having been Yugoslav\\nnational champion at under-16 and under-18 level in singles, doubles and mixed, he was\\nthe leading player to emerge from Serbia in the 1990s and he, Dusan Vemic and Dejan\\nPetrovic were the only Serbs playing regularly on the global pro tour. When the swimming\\npool at the ‘11 April’ sports club that had fallen into disrepair was refurbished as a carpeted\\nsingles tennis court, Zimonjic played an exhibition match at the official opening (the court\\nallowed Ana Ivanovic and Janko Tipsarevic to continue practising during the Belgrade\\nbombing and to learn something about playing on hard courts, as almost all the courts in\\nBelgrade at that time were clay – see pages 62–3).\\nHow good Zimonjic might have been had he not had diplomatic obstacles put in his way\\nis open to question, but in some ways his contribution to Djokovic comes from what he\\nlearned from the post-1999 privations. He says,\\nAt first we had one of the best passports in Europe but then, when the war started, I\\nhad to practise somewhere else. I was in the US and I saw how Serbia was being\\npresented in the media. All the media talked about us as being really bad and then I’d\\nbe on the phone to my parents and they would tell me a completely different side of\\nthe story. And then you’d listen to what they talk about on CNN or hear about your\\ncountry, about your people, something you can’t imagine. If you hear stories like this\\nand you don’t know Serbia, you would think, ‘What kind of people are these\\nSerbians?’ At first, we couldn’t compete, you couldn’t travel – when we got to borders,\\nofficials looked at us as if we were some kind of terrorists. And then there was the\\n1999 bombing and your family is there – that was really difficult. Sometimes I was\\nthere, sometimes I was outside but it wasn’t pretty at all. People went through really',\n",
       " 'tough times. I felt I learned a lot through my own experience – I made a lot of mistakes,\\nI didn’t have much support, but I learned a lot and I wanted to pass it on, so it wouldn’t\\ntake others as long as it took me to learn about life on the tour.\\nZimonjic became aware of the promising Novak Djokovic before he was a teenager.\\n‘Srdjan used me a lot,’ Zimonjic adds. ‘He asked what I thought about the idea of Nole\\ngoing to the Pilic Academy. I said I thought it was a great thing to do. Pilic was a great\\nplayer, he coached a lot of guys. We didn’t have the high-quality coaches, so you can only\\nbenefit. If you look at all our players, they all practised outside Serbia.’\\nZimonjic began to see a great Serbian generation coming around 2000. In early 2001\\nSerbia had the world’s top two juniors in Jelena Jankovic and Janko Tipsarevic, Djokovic\\nhad been spotted, as had Dejan Katic, who was the Orange Bowl under-12s champion in\\nDecember 2000. And there were other promising juniors, such as Ilija Bozoljac, Viktor\\nTroicki and Ana Ivanovic, all born between 1985 and 87, plus Boris Pashanski, a player\\nalready on the Futures circuit. Not all of them would make it, but if a handful did, Zimonjic\\ncould see it creating a golden era for Serbia.\\nIn 2001 Zimonjic, by then a top-20 doubles player, invited Djokovic to practise with him\\nat the Gemax club. He recalls,\\nWe did two-on-one drills and I remember, even at 14, if he didn’t have to move or run,\\nhe would never miss a ball. He was already consistent then. He was incredible. I\\nknew he was going to be a very good player but I had no idea he was going to be this\\ngood, mentally so strong, and to have the career he’s had. He did some work there\\nwith Ladislav Kis, then at Partizan with Marco Nesic, then with Bogdan Obradovic, so\\nwith a variety of coaches. He was working with the same fitness coach I had, Zoran\\nGrebovic, and they used the same physio I had. They were trying to see what I was\\ndoing as a top player, to watch someone who was very professional and to copy that.\\nThe next stage was to see what the best in the world were doing in singles and, since\\nhe was 15 or 16, he always had a physio travelling with him. He was with Milos\\n[Jelasavcic], who was my physio as well. I got Milos into the Davis Cup team. All this\\nshows you how professional Novak was. He thinks of all the small details and the\\nprevention of small injuries. Although he is doing incredible things like sliding on hard\\ncourts, you see how flexible he is and how well his body is taken care of. He didn’t\\nmiss much because of injury.\\nZimonjic was in the driving seat when Tipsarevic made his debut in the Davis Cup at 15 in\\nTunisia. For two years (2003 and 2004), Zimonjic was the Serbian team’s player/captain\\nand gave either debuts or sparring opportunities to Djokovic, Bozoljac and Troicki. His\\nultimate reward came in December 2010 when Serbia won the Davis Cup. Zimonjic, by\\nthen 34, was very much the elder statesman in a team made up of the 23-year-old\\nDjokovic, the 24-year-old Troicki and the 26-year-old Tipsarevic, and no doubt some saw\\nhim as just an elder brother brought in to stop the young pups from going overboard. But\\nwhile Djokovic was the clear team leader and Troicki scored the winning point, Zimonjic\\nhad done much to lay the foundations for his country’s greatest tennis achievement as a\\nnation.\\n \\nWhile Zimonjic gave Djokovic his first chance in Davis Cup, Pilic gave him his first chance\\nin tournaments. Pilic revelled in the title of \\n‘Master Coach’ of the German tennis\\nassociation DTB. That made him not only the head of a network of around 11,500 coaches',\n",
       " 'but he had wildcards (entry to the draw for tournaments) to give out for tennis events on\\nGerman soil. As Pilic had a Futures tournament in Oberschleissheim (the suburb of Munich\\nwhere he had his academy) in the first week of January, he gave one to Djokovic in 2003.\\nThat allowed Djokovic to play his first match in a professional tournament. He lost to the\\nGerman Alex Radulescu 7–5, 7–6 but that was not a bad start for a 15-year-old.\\nPilic also had influence outside Germany and requested a wildcard for Djokovic to play\\nin four Futures-level tournaments in Belgrade in June and July. In late June, when the\\ncream of the tennis world was at Wimbledon and Roger Federer was preparing to win his\\nfirst major title, Djokovic beat Cesar Ferrer-Victoria 6–4, 7–5 in the final of the tournament\\nat the Red Star Belgrade club. It was his first professional title and it was a source of great\\npride to all those who had helped Djokovic that it should have come on Serbian soil.\\nBased on what today’s juniors are put through, Djokovic played very few international\\ntournaments in those days. His first one was the under-14s event in the French town of\\nTarbes known as ‘Les Petits As’ (the little aces) in February 2001, when he came up\\nagainst a Scottish lad aged just a week older called Andrew Murray. Murray won the match\\n6–0, 7–6. These days, when asked what he remembers of the match, Djokovic says,\\n‘Andy’s curly hair and the fact that I was crushed.’ Whether losing the second set on a tie-\\nbreak is really a crushing is open to debate but Djokovic clearly felt it was. Despite that\\ndefeat, Djokovic ended 2001 at the top of the Tennis Europe Junior Tour’s ‘14 & Under’\\nrankings, one place ahead of Murray at No. 2.\\nHe only played three junior Grand Slam tournaments and, while he had a trip to Florida\\nin late 2002 for three tournaments culminating in the Orange Bowl, most of his events were\\nin Europe, \\nwith a large number in Serbia and Germany for practical and financial reasons.\\nHe got a taste for representing his country in team-tennis events when he led Serbia &\\nMontenegro to victory in the Copa del Sol, the 14 & Under European outdoor team event.\\nAnd in 2003 he competed in the Junior Davis Cup in Germany. He won all his five matches\\nas ‘Yugoslavia’ (in effect Serbia & Montenegro) finished fifth.\\nHis three Grand Slam junior events were the French and US Opens in 2003 and the\\n2004 Australian. He reached the third round in Paris, lost in the first in New York and was a\\nsemi-finalist in Melbourne. A decade on, it’s interesting to see who has made it from those\\nwho posted wins against the future world No. 1: his conqueror in Paris was Daniel\\nGimeno-Traver, in New York it was Robert Smeets and in Melbourne Josselin Ouanna. He\\nalso lost to Gael Monfils in the third round of a warm-up event in Melbourne. Gimeno-\\nTraver, Smeets and Ouanna have all gone on to have modest careers with occasional\\nmoments in the limelight but none has got anywhere near Djokovic’s achievements. It’s a\\nsalutary lesson that a list of the world’s most promising juniors is no guide to world ranking\\nlists of the future.\\nThe weekend that Djokovic reached the semis in Melbourne, Serbia won its first Grand\\nSlam main-draw title as Serbia (even though, technically, it was still Serbia & Montenegro,\\nthe last two remaining Yugoslav republics – the acronym YUG had been replaced by SCG\\nin 2003, as opposed to today’s SRB for Serbia alone; any temptation to opt for S&M was\\nresisted). Nenad Zimonjic partnered the Russian Elena Bovina to victory in the mixed\\ndoubles, beating the defending champions Leander Paes and 47-year-old Martina\\nNavratilova 6–1, 7–6 in the final. Zimonjic had invited the 16-year-old Djokovic to sit in his\\nbox for the final and it was a natural extension for the player to invite the youngster to join\\nthe celebrations. At the party they held in a Melbourne \\nnightclub, one of the revellers was\\nMarat Safin, Djokovic’s idol. A year later they were to be rubbing shoulders in Melbourne\\nagain but this time on the Rod Laver Arena in a match with great significance for both of',\n",
       " 'them.\\n \\nOn 22 May 2004 Djokovic turned 17. He was ranked 515 in the world but, having just won\\nback-to-back Futures and Challenger tournaments in Hungary, he was guaranteed to jump\\n177 places to 338 just a couple of days later. Impressive enough, but what had become of\\nGencic’s prediction that he would be in the best five in the world on his 17th birthday?\\n‘Maybe I got it wrong,’ she said without much sheepishness, ‘but he had two very important\\nyears when he should have been in international junior competition in Europe and the\\nAmericas but they hadn’t got money to send him, so he didn’t travel. It would have been\\nwhen he was 14 or 15. So yes, he was a year late but I still believed he’d be the best. I\\nexplained to Novak and the family, “Don’t worry, be patient, he’ll be the best.”’ (Actually, by\\nher prediction, he was three years late: Djokovic didn’t break into the top five until 30 April\\n2007, but that was the time when a shift was taking place which meant the top players\\ntended to mature later than had been the norm a decade or two before.)\\nOne of the most significant milestones in Djokovic’s career had come about six months\\nbefore his 17th birthday.\\nOver the years when Srdjan had been seeking funding for his son’s burgeoning career,\\nhe had become gradually more successful as Novak’s results started to justify all the\\npromise. A meeting with Amit Naor proved particularly fruitful. Naor was an Israeli agent\\nwho was ploughing an independent furrow in player management and representation, not\\nan easy job in a market cornered for many years by three big players: IMG, Advantage\\nInternational (now Octagon) and ProServ (later SFx, now Blue Entertainment). Naor was\\nalready working with Ivan Ljubicic, the thoughtful Croat \\nwhose star was in the ascendant in\\n2003–4 after several years of steady but unremarkable results, and was keen to recruit\\nsomeone from the next generation.\\nThe deal Naor did together with his business associate Allon Khakshourian and the\\nGerman coach-cum-agent Dirk Hordoff effectively ended the family’s financial worries. The\\nnegotiations were slightly comical, in that Srdjan had refused to learn any English, so\\nBogdan Obradovic had to interpret during discussions in an upmarket hotel. But the\\nsubstance meant Djokovic and his family were provided for. The deal was reported to\\nprovide around €250,000 a year. The sum has never been confirmed and such figures\\nhave to be treated with caution, as they are normally a media construct based on maximum\\npayments in an arrangement that pays more if certain performance targets are met. But\\nwhatever the exact figure, from then on, the player and his family were effectively in the\\nclear.\\nIn some ways, the deal should have come five years earlier – that was when the\\nDjokovics needed the money, whereas by late 2003 Novak was on the point of starting to\\nearn decent prize money. But the deal added to the sense of progress. For example,\\nDjokovic got a wildcard into the ATP tournament in Bangkok in September 2004, an event\\nwhere Khakshourian was the tournament director.\\nIn 2008 Naor and Khakshourian entered an arrangement with the Hollywood talent\\nagency CAA, which effectively took Djokovic to CAA. The agency was also keen to break\\nthe IMG/Octagon/SFx stranglehold, and Naor and Khakshourian recognised they had a\\nbetter chance of succeeding as part of a bigger entity than on their own. Djokovic stayed\\nwith CAA until the end of 2012, when he switched to IMG, but the big deal for him was the\\nfirst one done by Naor, Khakshourian and Hordoff.\\nAfter all, at that time there was no guarantee he would go on to post the body of work he\\nhas subsequently posted. In fact, if ever \\nthere was a time in Djokovic’s career when he was',\n",
       " 'in danger of drifting, it was just before and after his 17th birthday. He had left Pilic’s\\nacademy and had worked with a number of coaches in Serbia, but it wasn’t until\\nSeptember 2004 that he had his first touring coach.\\nDejan Petrovic was an Australian of Serbian parentage who was born and grew up in\\nAdelaide. He reached 116 in the doubles rankings but never cracked the top 150 in\\nsingles. However, having opted to play for Serbia, rather than Australia, he played three\\nDavis Cup ties, profiting from the relative lack of Serbian players in the post-Yugoslav\\nbreak-up era. He was, therefore, a largish fish in a smallish pond.\\nHe had first met Djokovic at the Gemax club in Belgrade when Djokovic was 14 and\\nbeing coached by Ladislav Kis, with whom Petrovic had played doubles in Australia.\\nAnother person based at Gemax was Milos Jelisavcic, the physiotherapist who worked\\nwith the Serbian Davis Cup team and later went on to travel with both Djokovic and Viktor\\nTroicki. Jelasavcic knew Petrovic well and suggested he ‘come and look at this kid and tell\\nme what you think’. Petrovic says, ‘What struck me was his will to win, and his self-belief\\nwas incredible. The first time we hit, he played a Futures at Red Star Belgrade and he won\\nit. For him at that age, it was phenomenal. I never saw anyone have so much passion to\\nwin. He liked to joke off court but when he was on court, he was totally focused. And he\\nhad a willingness to learn – he’s the best student I’ve come across, in all aspects.’\\nPetrovic was still on the tour, hopeful of advancing up both the singles and doubles\\nrankings, so his meetings with Djokovic were sporadic. They practised together at the\\nPartizan club and, at 16, Djokovic went to Adelaide for a week before the Australian junior\\ntournaments that culminated in the Australian Open boys singles. ‘We played a lot,’\\nPetrovic recalls. ‘He made semis of the Australian \\nOpen juniors and then, during the year,\\nhe came back to Belgrade for a week or so before a Futures and Challenger in Hungary.\\nHe won them both, so Srdjan kept contacting me, asking if I would work with Novak. At that\\nstage, I was still professional and playing Davis Cup for Serbia, so initially I said no.’\\nBut Petrovic had long-term plans. He planned to settle in Serbia and open a tennis\\nacademy. At 26, he had a couple of injuries and was struggling to improve on his best\\nsingles ranking of 157, yet he had been one of the highest-ranked Serbs since Slobodan\\nZivojinovic. Even though tennis wasn’t that popular, he felt his status as a Serb who had\\ncompeted at all four Grand Slams could help him be successful. But suddenly the\\nlandscape was a little different – perhaps the best thing he could do for his post-playing\\ncareer would be to invest in a player he felt could be an icon of Serbian tennis? True, the\\nopportunity to do so had come a few years earlier than he’d hoped, but here was this 17-\\nyear-old who Petrovic believed was going to be ‘the next big thing in Serbia’ and, if he\\nmade it to the top, what better advertising for the hoped-for academy?\\nPetrovic therefore gave up his playing career to become Djokovic’s first travelling coach.\\n‘I had an agreement with Srdjan for three years and a contract for one,’ he says. ‘I was very\\naware that I was doing it for Novak, that I’d be very happy if I could one day see him in the\\nbig scene but I also knew that, to get tennis started in Serbia, we needed a superstar.\\nSrdjan first approached me in May [2004] and I didn’t really hesitate, although I guess it\\ntook me about three months to formally say yes to the offer. Coming from Adelaide, I’d\\nknown Lleyton Hewitt as a kid – Lleyton lived 500 metres from me, he was the youngster\\nand I was the leader of the pack, and I saw a lot more in Novak than in Lleyton.’\\nThe 10 months that Petrovic and Djokovic worked together saw a massive improvement\\nin the player’s fortunes. In statistical terms, \\nhe went from 272 in September 2004 to 94 by\\nJuly 2005. More importantly, Petrovic helped Djokovic negotiate the often tricky passage\\nfrom the ‘Futures’ tournaments (the lowest level of professional competition, though still',\n",
       " 'with a very high level of play), first to the ‘Challengers’ (the intermediate level for players\\nranked between about 60 and 250) and then to the full tour, including Grand Slams.\\nPetrovic had experienced that transition as a player, so he was one of the few Serbs who\\nknew what it took.\\nDjokovic’s progress in the first four months was considerable. He beat the former\\nAustralian Open runner-up Arnaud Clement in three sets in Bucharest for his first tour-level\\nvictory – Clement’s best days were behind him but he was still ranked 67 to Djokovic’s\\n272. He was hammered 6–1, 6–1 by Wesley Moodie in the first round of qualifying for\\nanother tour-level event, the Swiss Indoors in Basel, but a month later he qualified for the\\nAachen Challenger and won it. OK, so he didn’t beat any big names of the time (he did\\nbeat Stanislas Wawrinka in the first round but Wawrinka was only 19) but he’d won eight\\nmatches in little more than a week and dropped just two sets. More importantly, he had\\nbroken into the world’s top 200 before the end of the year. In addition, Petrovic used the\\nfact that he himself still had a reasonable doubles ranking to get him and Djokovic into the\\ndoubles of the Helsinki Challenger – the coach-and-pupil pairing reached the semi-finals.\\nMark Woodforde, the doubles legend who was later to work with Djokovic, tells an\\ninteresting story from January 2005. ‘I was co-tournament director of the South Australian\\nOpen,’ he says, referring to January’s tour-level tournament in his home city of Adelaide.\\nNovak was working with Dejan. I knew Dejan pretty well and I remember him coming\\ninto the office and saying, ‘Look, Mark, I’ve got this youngster who I’m practising with\\nwho’s been here in Adelaide. Have you seen him?’ He told me his name but it meant\\nnothing to me. So he asked me if I’d be able to get him a wildcard into the main draw. I\\nsaid to Dejan, ‘Look, I can’t give a foreigner a wildcard,’ because my job was to use\\nthe wildcards to promote local interest and help young Australian talent. But he was\\nvery forthright and said, ‘What about qualifying?’ I said, ‘Because I’m working for\\nTennis Australia running this tournament, I can’t do that. You know how short we are\\non player opportunities.’ But he persisted, saying, ‘But this guy is going to be good.’\\nThis is a story you hear a lot as a tournament director, so I said, ‘Yeah, that’s great.’\\nBut Dejan said, ‘No, you don’t understand, he’s \\nreally\\n good.’ And I said, ‘OK. I’m sorry,\\nit’s definitely not going to happen in the main draw. As for qualifying, if there’s no one\\nthat comes because there are other tournaments going on, it’s a possibility, but it’s a\\nlong shot.’ So he asked me how he could get Novak a wildcard into other\\ntournaments. I told him he was following the right path by coming to me and asking me\\ndirectly because there aren’t too many people who would go up and boldly predict that\\ntheir player is going to be that good. So I suggested he call Colin Stubs [the former\\nAustralian Open tournament director who was in charge of the pre-Australian Open\\nexhibition tournament at Melbourne’s Kooyong Club] and call the other tournament\\ndirectors, because if they don’t know that he’s after the wildcard, word of mouth isn’t\\ngoing to happen. But still he persisted: ‘But Marco, I was really hoping you might be\\nable to help here because of the Adelaide connection.’ Nole was just around the\\ncorner, so he introduced me and I shook hands with this youngster. That was the first\\ntime I met him and it meant I had Dejan’s words in the back of my mind when Novak\\nasked me to do some work with him just over two years later.\\nAs it happened, Petrovic’s persistence paid off. Djokovic did get a wildcard into the\\nAdelaide qualifying tournament, and while he lost to Brian Baker in straight sets, the\\nexperience served him well for his next qualifying tournament, the Australian Open. After\\nbeating Francesco Piccari and Stanislas Wawrinka, he came up in the final round of',\n",
       " 'qualifying against Wesley Moodie, the South African who had crushed him in Basel just 10\\nweeks earlier. This time Djokovic was ready and, on a 6–4 final set, he reached the main\\ndraw of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time.\\nAnd who should he be drawn against but the man who had been celebrating with him in\\nNenad Zimonjic’s entourage a year earlier, his idol Marat Safin. It’s easy to dismiss Safin\\nas the tennis circuit’s wild child, and for much of his career he was. But approaching his\\n27th birthday, Safin had begun to realise that, if he was going to add to his sole major title\\n(the 2000 US Open) before hanging up his racket and going into politics, he needed to get\\na move on. He had teamed up with Roger Federer’s former coach Peter Lundren during\\n2004 and had very nearly beaten Federer in the semi-finals of the Tennis Masters Cup in\\nHouston, losing on a memorable 20–18 tie-break. So he was up for doing something big at\\nthe 2005 Australian Open and Djokovic was a bit like a hedgehog caught in the path of an\\noncoming juggernaut. Djokovic won just three games but he’d been given star billing on\\nthe first night session of the centenary Australian Open on the Rod Laver Arena. It was a\\nlandmark match for both men – Djokovic’s first main draw at a major, Safin’s first step\\ntowards his first and only Australian Open title.\\nThere’s a saying in tennis – and in various forms in all walks of life – that you learn more\\nfrom defeats than from victories, and Djokovic suffered a much more painful defeat two\\nmonths later. Playing for the first time in Euro-African Zone 1 of the Davis Cup, Serbia’s\\nexperienced player/captain Nenad Zimonjic said he couldn’t do both duties, so he\\nremained a doubles player and was \\nreplaced by Petrovic as Serbia’s Davis Cup captain.\\nTheir first match was a comfortable 5–0 win over Zimbabwe in Novi Sad, but then in April\\ncame the match in Belgrade that would have seen Serbia into the playoff round for the\\n2006 World Group. Belgium were the visitors and it was no embarrassment for Djokovic to\\nlose to the 33rd-ranked Olivier Rochus on the first day. But with Janko Tipsarevic having\\ncome back from two sets down to beat Rochus in five to level the tie at 2–2, Djokovic, by\\nnow ranked 142, faced Belgium’s Kristof Vliegen, a man ranked just 38 places higher, in\\nthe live fifth rubber. Vliegen won it in four sets, having never looked in danger, and Serbia\\nwere left with another year in the second tier of the team competition (two, as it turned out).\\nDespite winning the Challenger tournament in San Remo in May – the scene of his 14 &\\nUnder European Junior Championships triumphs – Djokovic’s ranking was still not high\\nenough for him to get automatic entry into the main draw of the French Open and\\nWimbledon (a player’s ranking needs to be 104 to be guaranteed entry into the main draw\\nof a Slam but 110 will normally suffice given a few injuries to higher-ranked players), so he\\nhad to go into the qualifying tournaments. In Paris, qualifying took place in the week of his\\n18th birthday, on 22 May 2005. And as with the Australian Open, he came through his\\nthree rounds comfortably.\\nKnowing his birthday would clash with French Open qualifying, Djokovic rescheduled\\nhis party, which took place at the Calling Club in Belgrade. It was a big party and one\\nwhich showed that Serbia’s business community had started to get wise to his potential.\\nHe got a car from a sponsor, albeit one he had to return a couple of months later, and one\\nof Serbia’s leading movie actors, Sergej Trifunovic, was present to sing a song he had\\ncomposed about Djokovic beating Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, the lyrics indicating\\nthat the time would come when he would beat these guys.\\nIt was not to come at the 2005 French Open or Wimbledon. At \\nRoland Garros, Robby\\nGinepri became the first man to lose to Djokovic in a Grand Slam main draw, before\\nDjokovic retired at one set all in his second-round match against the previous year’s\\nrunner-up Guillermo Coria. At Wimbledon, Djokovic beat Brian Baker, Jimmy Wang and',\n",
       " 'Wesley Moodie to qualify for the main draw and then beat Juan Monaco and Guillermo\\nGarcia-Lopez (the latter from two sets down) before losing to Sebastien Grosjean in the\\nthird round.\\nThe story of how Petrovic’s time with Djokovic ended is told on page 102. It is arguable\\nthat Djokovic would have made more progress between 18 and 20 if he’d stayed with\\nPetrovic than he actually did – he talked at the time about a ‘golden team’ of himself,\\nPetrovic and the physio Milos Jelisavcic. But given that Djokovic was a Grand Slam\\nchampion by the end of January 2008 and was the all-conquering world No. 1 in 2011, it’s\\nhard to make a case that the decision to part company was wrong. True, he seemed to\\nstagnate, certainly in ranking terms, during the subsequent eight months working with\\nRiccardo Piatti and Ivan Ljubicic, but in retrospect it’s clear he was learning things from the\\nItalian coach and Croatian player that were to help him in the long run.\\nPetrovic remains endearingly relaxed about his stint coaching Djokovic. ‘That 10 months\\nwas a great time,’ he says.\\nWe have a great relationship, Novak is like a son to me. Yes, it was nice playing Davis\\nCup and it was a wrench to give up that part of my playing career, but to have had that\\n10 months working with him – I don’t regret it at all. He appreciates it and that’s the\\nmost important thing for me – I don’t need any financial reward, I’m just happy with the\\nfulfilment of being a piece of the puzzle at a crucial period of his playing career and in\\nhelping him move up to the top 100 so quickly. Players like Becker, Federer, Nadal\\nand Novak – they’re one in a million, not really from this planet, so I feel blessed to\\nhave been able to work with one of them.\\nSo was Djokovic’s time with Petrovic the last chapter of his childhood or the first chapter of\\nhis professional career? It’s hard to say and ultimately it doesn’t matter. Djokovic had a\\npath dotted with stepping stones and Petrovic clearly escorted him to a very important\\nplace. But it’s possible to argue that the laid-back Petrovic could only have taken Djokovic\\nso far and that, eventually, he would have needed a stricter and more focused team. By\\nqualifying for the Australian Open, qualifying and winning a round at the French Open, and\\nqualifying and winning two rounds at Wimbledon, Djokovic had laid the launch pad for the\\nexplosion in his career that was to start within a year.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER SIX\\nFATHERS AND SONS\\nT\\nhe period in Djokovic’s development from about 2001to 2010 – from the ages of 14 to 23\\n– features a recurring theme. Or perhaps that should be a recurring sore because it adds\\nan unsavoury element to the Djokovic story but one without which the story cannot be\\nproperly told. The theme is the role played by his father, Srdjan. It is a difficult topic on\\nwhich to remain scrupulously fair but which is ultimately understandable in context. All the\\nelements of a turbulent Russian novel are there – pride, family loyalty, hate and a lust for\\nrevenge.\\nSrdjan Djokovic was always going to do his best for his eldest son, but it would have\\nbeen a lot easier for him if that son’s gift was in football or skiing. Because he knew\\nnothing about tennis, he was to a certain extent out of his depth. Yet faced with wise\\ncounsels telling him he had not only a very gifted tennis-playing child but potentially a\\nworld-beater, he set about trying to do what was necessary to fund Novak’s rise.\\nUltimately, he succeeded but, having \\ngone through a number of harsh learning\\nexperiences along the way, his abrasiveness left its mark on many of those who were\\ncrucial to Djokovic’s rise. If Srdjan had been blessed with his eldest son’s benevolent\\ntemper and willingness to see the good sides of people, he would probably have had an\\neasier ride. But the combination of an indifferent – sometimes hostile – environment and\\nthe insecurities of his own temperament meant that, at several stages in the Novak\\nDjokovic story, his father was the villain in the background, and sometimes the villain in the\\nforeground.\\nThere are many who witnessed Srdjan’s stormy \\nmodus operandi\\n. Some are more willing\\nto speak about it than others. Many say he was right, or mostly right, but in the wrong way.\\nAll speak more in sorrow than in anger. None seems to take any satisfaction from the\\nvolatile father of Serbia’s favourite son, and many are willing to recognise an element of\\nbravery in his single-minded pursuit of his son’s career. As one victim of Srdjan’s\\ntempestuous reactions put it, ‘He stuck his head where most people wouldn’t put their feet,\\nall in the best interests of his son.’\\nThe case for the defence comes later but it’s worth outlining some of the episodes that\\nled to Srdjan Djokovic becoming such a divisive figure.\\nOne of the first people to be aware of Srdjan’s impetuosity was Ladislav Kis. Kis was\\nDjokovic’s coach at the Gemax club in Belgrade under an arrangement funded by\\nGemax’s founder and owner, the industrialist Djordjo Antelj. What exactly the arrangement\\nentailed is not known as it was a private agreement, but it appears to have been a\\ngenerous one by any standards, especially by the standards of Serbia’s precarious\\neconomy just two years after the Nato bombing. It is thought to have involved Djokovic\\ngetting three meals a day in the club’s restaurant, massage, all his coaching, plus trips to\\ntournaments with Kis and one accompanying parent – all paid for. Kis was contracted to\\ncoach \\nDjokovic and another promising junior of the same age, Branko Kusmanovic. Kis\\nrecalls,\\nI was being crucified. I was on court in the morning for two hours with Novak and then\\ntwo hours with Branko, and then in the afternoon it was another two hours with Novak',\n",
       " 'and two hours with Branko. I was starting to get seriously tired – these boys could\\nplay, it wasn’t like doing basket drills all day long. So I asked to adjust the daily\\nschedule so Novak could hit with Branko. Novak was the better player but it wasn’t\\nlike Branko couldn’t train with him – whenever they did play a training set, it was\\nalways close, even if Novak won five out of six on average. So the schedule was\\nchanged to put them together three days a week for two hours in the afternoon. But\\nSrdjan didn’t like it: he said his boy wasn’t playing with a kid that’s weaker than him. I\\nsaid this is an arrangement that everyone has approved and it’s better having me fresh\\nfor all the lessons, but he just threw the piece of paper on which the agreement was\\nset out back at me. When you think about it, it’s nonsense! Who does Novak practise\\nwith now he’s No. 2 in the world – with Rafa? No, you don’t need always to have\\nbetter people to practise with. Branko was good for him and Novak didn’t mind, but\\nSrdjan wasn’t having his son practising with weaker players, and Novak had no word\\nin it.\\nAccording to Kis, Srdjan then went to Antelj and asked for Jelena Gencic to be allowed to\\naccompany the Djokovic team on his next trip. Antelj said it was out of the question – he\\nwas paying a lot of money for one coach (Kis) and one accompanying parent, so he wasn’t\\ngoing to fund a second coach, especially one who had coached Novak before he was 12.\\nSrdjan is reported to have stood his ground, whereupon Antelj threw him out, apparently\\nwith a \\nletter saying all the Djokovic family were banned from Gemax except Novak. ‘Novak\\nwas crying his eyes out when he left that day,’ says Kis, ‘because we really did work well\\ntogether. But that was the end of the working relationship.’\\nAnother person to get a tongue-lashing from Srdjan around the same time was Vojin\\nVelickovic. Velickovic is the tennis correspondent for \\nSportski Zurnal\\n, Serbia’s national\\nsports daily newspaper (similar to the French daily \\nL’Equipe\\n), and he attended a junior\\ntournament in 2001 because there were two promising Serbian boys, Dejan Katic and\\nDjokovic. Katic had won the Orange Bowl under-12s competition the previous December\\n(the Orange Bowl is the most prestigious junior tournament outside the four Grand Slam\\njunior events and the culmination of the junior year), so was ahead of Djokovic at that\\nstage. ‘Because Katic had won the Orange Bowl and Novak hadn’t won anything, I put\\nKatic in the headline,’ says Velickovic. ‘When he saw it, Srdjan called me. He was furious\\nbecause he thought his son was always to be No. 1 in everything. He was very angry\\nabout that – that was my first contact with him.’ For the record, Katic never made it into the\\nbig time – he broke into the world’s top 600 but never graduated beyond the ‘Futures’\\nsatellite circuit.\\nSomething similar happened at the 2004 Australian Open. Djokovic had done very well\\nto reach the semi-finals of the boys’ singles but the mixed doubles was won by Nenad\\nZimonjic, partnering the Russian Elena Bovina. ‘OK, so it was just the mixed,’ Velickovic\\nrecalls, ‘but it was the first Grand Slam title of this generation and Novak had only reached\\nthe semi-finals of the boys singles, so we could easily have put Zimonjic on the cover. But\\nwe decided to put them both on the front page. The editor of my newspaper then got a call\\nfrom Srdjan. He was furious because his son was given equal status as someone who had\\nwon the mixed – “What is the mixed?!” he was saying. With him, there’s always something\\nhappening.’\\nAnother member of the Serbian media to meet Djokovic at the age of 12 was Nebojsa\\nViskovic. A regular commentator for the state-funded national television service RTS,\\nViskovic saw the potential of Djkovic and wanted to do all he could to help. At one stage',\n",
       " 'he tried to use his work for a government project to leverage $100,000 for Djokovic. It came\\nto nothing as the letter he wrote was ignored, but he tried. He also took Djokovic’s middle\\nbrother Marko on some trips to Geneva when working for RTS. Viskovic says,\\nI was working on a TV magazine programme and I did a number of features with\\nNovak. I felt he could be a great player, he had a good position in the junior rankings,\\nand I just sensed it. People I spoke to who were experts said, ‘There is something\\nabout him that could be very special – he has great potential.’ There were no\\ntournaments in Serbia, so he had to travel a lot within Europe, so I didn’t have much\\nchance to watch him playing. But everyone whose opinion was valued was saying\\ngood things about him. We had had no quality players since Bobo Zivojinovic, so I felt\\nit would be a good investment to get to know Novak while he was still a young junior.\\nHe told me I was the best in the business and he valued my opinion, which was nice\\nfor me – I suppose he’d heard me on TV.\\nViskovic certainly felt he had a good relationship with both Djokovic’s parents, but he was\\nto learn that, the moment Srdjan felt someone had been the slightest bit critical of his son,\\nhe or she became \\npersona non grata\\n and all previous help was forgotten.\\nThe first public sign of conflict came when Serbia travelled to Geneva in September\\n2006 to play Switzerland in a Davis Cup playoff round tie. A month before, Srdjan had\\nmade comments in the Serbian media denigrating Roger Federer (whether that added to\\nFederer’s venom in his final press conference that weekend is not \\nclear – see page 166).\\nSrdjan then told Viskovic that he wanted him to cheer for Djokovic like a supporter when\\ncommentating. ‘He wanted me to just ignore the opponent’s good moves, or to be silent,’\\nrecalls Viskovic. ‘Basically, he wanted me to be a fan, which is totally different from my\\npoint of view of what a commentator has to do. A commentator has to be objective. Of\\ncourse, when a Serbian player is on court you do move the boundary a little because I\\nwant him to win and my viewers do, but you still have to be objective.’\\nViskovic’s refusal to change his commentary style meant further clashes were always\\nlikely, and the next flashpoint came during the semi-finals of the 2008 Hamburg Masters\\nwhen Djokovic – by now Australian Open champion – faced Rafael Nadal.\\nViskovic was commentating on his own from RTS’s studios in Belgrade. The first set\\nwas keenly fought, Nadal eventually taking it 7–5. As Viskovic signed off for the two-minute\\nend-of-set break, Srdjan stormed into the commentary booth, screaming at the security\\nguards, ‘I’m the father of Novak Djokovic!’ Viskovic recalls, ‘He marched in, he told me it\\nwas a disgrace that I’m a Serbian commentator and that I’m obsessed with Nadal, or\\nsomething like that. I just told him to walk away, or something similar. The microphone was\\noff – he was sufficiently sensitive to know he couldn’t do it when the microphone was live –\\nbut it was very aggressive and I found it was really hard to concentrate after that. I was\\nreally upset and, as I happened to have some sedative pills in my bag, I took one.’\\nThe following Monday, Viskovic got hold of Alexander Tijanic, the editor-in-chief at RTS,\\nand said he wanted him to listen to the recording and judge what had happened. ‘I wanted\\nprotection,’ Viskovic says, ‘but I didn’t get it. The editor told me he would handle it in his\\nown way, which meant doing nothing to offend Srdjan.’\\nViskovic obviously felt he was on moderately safe ground, for he ignored Tijanic’s\\nrequest to say nothing to the media. The media got \\nto hear about Srdjan’s invasion of the\\ncommentary box and it became a big story. A Facebook group entitled ‘Support for\\nNebojsa Viskovic’ was set up and, for a few days, it reached 10,000 followers. Whether\\nthat protected Viskovic’s position within RTS is hard to tell – it must have been tempting for',\n",
       " 'Tijanic and co to fire a commentator who was increasingly at loggerheads with the father of\\nthe country’s emerging sporting hero. But Viskovic was being portrayed as the good guy in\\nthe media, and the station’s failure to protect him was looking somewhat shabby.\\nNot that it made much difference in the long run. Nine months later, the inaugural\\nSerbian Open took place at the ‘Novak’ club in Belgrade. It was a low-ranking ATP tour-\\nlevel tournament built on the back of Djokovic’s success. Srdjan, who was a leading light\\nin the tournament organisation, asked RTS to exclude Viskovic from the RTS commentary\\nteam at the tournament – it was not just a request for Viskovic to be banned from\\ncommentating on Djokovic’s matches, but any match. Srdjan backed up his request with a\\nthreat that he would give the TV rights to another broadcaster if Viskovic was allowed to\\ncommentate. The RTS editor conceded, whereupon Viskovic quit. Viskovic says RTS,\\nprobably fearing a media backlash, offered him more money, but he said no, saying there\\nwould only be more problems in the future.\\nOne could argue that the tactic backfired on Srdjan. Viskovic had been doing a bit of\\nmoonlighting for an emerging independent sports station, \\nSport Klub\\n, which had started in\\n2006 and was looking to expand its rights portfolio. So \\nSport Klub\\n snapped up Viskovic as\\none of its leading tennis commentators.\\nInterestingly, Viskovic says Srdjan tried to put pressure on the editor of \\nSport Klub\\n not to\\ngive Viskovic Djokovic’s matches, but counter-intuitive as it may seem, it was the private\\nstation that stood up to Srdjan in a way the state-funded broadcaster hadn’t. The result has\\nbeen that Viskovic now commentates more matches than \\nwhen he was with RTS, and far\\nmore of Djokovic’s. \\nSport Klub\\n has the rights to show 54 ATP tournaments a year,\\nincluding all the Masters-1000 Series and the ATP World Tour Finals, so Viskovic\\ncommentates on almost every match Djokovic plays outside the four Grand Slam\\ntournaments (Wimbledon is the only major for which \\nSport Klub\\n has rights).\\nThere was one final skirmish between Srdjan and Viskovic. In April 2010 the Serbian\\nTennis Federation asked Viskovic to be master of ceremonies for the Fed Cup home tie\\nbetween Serbia and the Slovak Republic. When Srdjan found out, he told the federation\\nthat this was not possible. Given the dependence of the federation on Djokovic’s\\nwillingness to play Davis Cup (and Serbia had not won the cup at that point), it was hardly\\nsurprising that Viskovic was stood down. He was given his agreed fee but told he could not\\nwork as MC. The story again got into the media, with one newspaper, \\nKurir\\n, running a\\ndouble-picture on its front page with Viskovic as the good guy and Srdjan the bad guy.\\nDjokovic clearly saw it, but Serbia’s Davis Cup captain Bogdan Obradovic, who was both\\na former coach of Djokovic and a good friend of Viskovic, explained exactly how the\\nproblem had come about and that Srdjan was largely the cause of it.\\nSince 2009–10, Srdjan and Viskovic have acted as if the other doesn’t exist. ‘Voja\\nVelickovic doesn’t speak with Srdjan,’ Viskovic says. ‘Every journalist in Serbia has a\\nproblem with Srdjan, I just had the biggest problem.’\\nYet it wasn’t just coaches and members of the media who Srdjan fell out with. In April\\n2004, three months after Djokovic had reached the Australian Open boys’ semi-finals, the\\nSerbian Davis Cup player-captain Nenad Zimonjic picked the still-17-year-old to be the\\nfourth member of his Davis Cup team for the tie against Latvia. The tie was played on a fast\\nindoor carpet at the Gemax club in Belgrade. Zimonjic was still playing singles and had\\nwon a \\nChallenger-level tournament a few weeks before, he had the young Janko\\nTipsarevic for second singles, who by then was inside the world’s top 200, and he had\\nDejan Petrovic, who had been top 150 in doubles. So he didn’t need Djokovic, but having\\nhad him as a hitting partner for a couple of Davis Cup weekends, Zimonjic named him in',\n",
       " 'the team for experience.\\nDjokovic fully expected to play and was very disappointed when he didn’t. ‘It was\\namazing,’ Zimonjic recalls. ‘He thought he was going to play on the first day. I remember\\nhim telling me he was so disappointed he couldn’t play. I said, “Listen, you’ll get the\\nchance to play but you have to start gradually. It’s a lot of pressure in Davis Cup, you’re still\\nyoung, there’s plenty of time for you, even when you play a dead rubber it’s going to be\\ntough for you to handle this.” He was talking about, “When am I going to have a chance to\\nplay, what do I have to do to earn a chance to play?” He was never afraid of the challenge.\\nI’ve never seen him afraid of anybody, or of having this responsibility, whoever it was. That\\nwas incredible, even then.’ Djokovic accepted the decision and was ultimately happy to\\nmake his Davis Cup debut in a dead rubber against Janis Skroderis, a match he won 6–2,\\n6–2 to see Serbia to a 5–0 win.\\nLess accepting of the decision was Srdjan. ‘He thought it was my biggest mistake that I\\ndidn’t play Novak on the first day,’ says Zimonjic. ‘He didn’t approve and from that point on\\nwe didn’t talk at all. The next time we really said hello was over a year later, when Novak\\ninvited me to his 18th birthday party and his parents were welcoming the guests. Novak\\nasked me six or seven times, “Please come.” That was the first time I said hello to Srdjan\\nafter that Davis Cup tie. Once Novak turned 18, it was a lot easier to deal with him because\\nI could do most things directly and not through Srdjan – I have respect for Srdjan and he\\nhas respect for me but I don’t really communicate that much with him.’\\nDejan Petrovic tells a similar story. He was Djokovic’s coach from late summer 2004 to\\njust after Wimbledon 2005. He was brought in to see Djokovic through the Futures and\\nChallenger tournaments and into the realm of tour-level and Grand Slam draws. During the\\n10 months they worked together, Djokovic moved from 272 to 94 in the rankings, at that\\ntime the highest-rising player on the ATP circuit.\\n‘No one quite knows why it ended and there’s no satisfactory explanation,’ Petrovic\\nsays. ‘Srdjan plays a huge part in the story. He always was the boss. Huge credit goes to\\nhim, whether you like him or not. He always tried to give Nole everything, the best that he\\npossibly could. Nole knows that. Srdjan shares Nole’s hunger for victory but Srdjan is a\\nvery hard man. The downfall for him is that he burns bridges. During the time you’re with\\nhim, you can’t really complain that much. He’s a nice man to have a beer with. If he likes\\nyou, it’s fine, but if he doesn’t like you, well, he doesn’t like you and there’s nothing you\\ncan do about it. I think he regrets a lot of those things.’\\nPetrovic says he had a verbal agreement to work with Djokovic for three years, and a\\ncontract for one year, yet never received any compensation for his employment being\\nterminated early. Not that it seems to worry him – he has the non-confrontational laid-\\nbackness of the Australian more than the wounded pride of the Serb and is happy to have\\nbeen a helping hand on Djokovic’s route to the top. Although he gave up his playing career\\nto coach Djokovic, his long-term aim was always to set up an academy in Serbia, and he\\nhas one now in Kragujevac, about 130 kilometres south of Belgrade. Djokovic’s presence\\nat the top of the world rankings is the biggest boost to Petrovic’s welfare that he could\\nwant, and he also coached the next rising Serb, Nikola Milojevic, for a while, so he has a\\nhand in two players who could enhance the standing of tennis in Serbia.\\n \\nBut Petrovic only hints at the language used by Srdjan when Djokovic Sr fired him:\\nMy culture is never to hate anyone and, in that sense, I don’t really understand the way\\nSrdjan finished with me. It wasn’t very nice; the words he used were not acceptable for',\n",
       " 'somebody who stopped their career and basically gave their heart to his son. It wasn’t\\nan appropriate way to finish. He fired me but there was no need to do it like that. My\\nculture, coming from Australia, was always to do things in a nice, diplomatic way and I\\nwas never an aggressive person, so to this day I don’t understand his philosophy. But\\nI understand that’s how he ends all relationships. Srdjan has his own philosophy and\\nhe’s got a short fuse. If he had a bigger fuse, if he had time to think about it, he\\nwouldn’t say some of the things he does. But he gets fired up. And he never\\napologises. Apologising isn’t in his system. I understand that if someone speaks badly\\nabout his son, he would automatically be in conflict. But when someone means the\\nbest for his son and would almost do anything for his son – that I didn’t understand\\nand, to this day, I don’t understand his philosophy in that regard. It’s something Novak\\nhas changed because Srdjan was ruining his reputation.\\nDjokovic has, indeed, become more the boss since becoming an adult but he has done so\\nslowly and subtly. And the way Petrovic’s time with him came to an end illustrates that he\\nwas never going to go against his father until he could stand on his own feet. Petrovic\\nsays,\\nWe were in this house for the [Wimbledon] qualifying tournament and, when he\\nqualified, I said, ‘OK, it’s time for a beer to celebrate qualifying for Wimbledon.’ So he\\nhad a very rare beer to celebrate. That’s when I announced that this would be the last\\ntournament we’d be working together. I’d had a meeting with Srdjan after Roland\\nGarros and knew that Wimbledon would be the last one … We both had tears in our\\neyes and we hugged each other. I said, ‘Let’s make sure we finish on a high.’ And he\\ngot to the third round that year, so we did go out on a high. Srdjan was the boss, so\\nNole couldn’t make the decisions. He knew how much the family had made sacrifices\\nfor him, so there was no question of him saying, ‘No, I don’t want to switch from\\nPetrovic to Piatti.’\\nSo was Srdjan a monster? Almost certainly not, even if he did often behave in a way that\\nleft people feeling he was pretty monstrous.\\nSrdjan himself has never given an interview in English and he rarely gives interviews in\\nSerbian. But he did agree to an hour-long interview with Serbia’s B92 television station\\ntwo months after Serbia had won the Davis Cup in December 2010. Disaffected with the\\nleadership of Djordjo Antelj and Slobodan Zivojinovic in the Serbian Tennis Federation,\\nSrdjan was part of a coup to oust the industrialist and the former Wimbledon semi-finalist.\\nMost of the interview is about the federation and the coup, but in the last few minutes he\\ntalks about himself and the role he played in doing his best for his eldest son:\\nI don’t think I’m arrogant. I don’t think I’m unpleasant. I only say what I think is right and\\njust. I say what I mean. We as a family have nothing to be ashamed of. And I as head\\nof this family have nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing to cover up. If something hurts\\nme, I talk about it. I expect people to accept what I say in a right way. And believe me,\\nordinary folk in cities across Serbia not only accept it in a right way but accept it with\\nenthusiasm because I say what I mean. I don’t hide behind the fancy statements of\\nsome marketing agency. They know very well how difficult our life as a family has\\nbeen for the last 17 years. We lived in rented apartments, we had to borrow money\\nsince we didn’t have enough ourselves, even though we had reasonable income for\\nthe times. Novak’s expenses for his career were more than we could afford. We',\n",
       " 'borrowed money from loan sharks at 10, 12, 15 per cent monthly interest rates. And\\nwe struggled to repay these loans – it was bloody hard. It even happened on\\nnumerous occasions that we didn’t have money to buy our daily bread. And then we\\nsold all the gold jewellery that my wife and I owned. And then we slept on a sofa bed\\nin a living room of one of those rented apartments for 10 years. We couldn’t afford a\\nnew mattress; instead we used old blankets to cover the springs which were poking\\ninto our chest and back.\\nAsked whether it was all worth it, he said, ‘Of course, but without any help from anybody.\\nNot the country, or the city officials, or the tennis association.’\\nSome context is needed here. Serbia in the early 2000s was a country recovering from a\\nbloody civil war and the loss of its preeminent position in a country where it was the most\\ninfluential of six federated states. Needless to say, not every business transaction that took\\nplace in Serbia was entirely clean, much business was conducted under the table, and\\nmany people in Serbia who did well at that time would not welcome too much scrutiny of\\ntheir business affairs. It was in this environment that Srdjan saw it as his job to finance the\\nlaunch pad for his son’s career. He sold his Belgrade restaurant around this time to free up\\ncash for Novak to fund his travelling as a junior, and he eventually got rid of the pizzeria in\\nKopaonik, albeit in a long lawsuit involving complications over the fact that he had used\\nthe premises rent-free for many years. No \\nsuggestion of impropriety is made here, but\\nsome understanding is needed of the difficult economic climate in which he was operating,\\none in which it would probably be unfair to condemn those who sought merely to find a\\nlevel playing field.\\nThe problem is that Srdjan’s abrasiveness not only created enemies but means he is\\nsometimes judged by reputation. He has told the story of having gone to a government\\nofficial to ask for money and been turned away empty-handed. But there is a version of that\\nstory that suggests Srdjan was the architect of his own undoing. According to this version,\\nthe official concerned had a habit of recording all conversations. Srdjan had gone in with a\\ncouple of friends and, at one stage in the interview, the official had left the room, ostensibly\\nto check something but in reality to listen in to the conversation being held in his absence\\nbetween Srdjan and his friends. As Srdjan’s tone had changed from polite benevolence to\\ndisparaging comments about the official, the interview came to nothing – in fact, the official\\nis alleged to have confronted Srdjan with what he had said during his absence. Whether\\nthe story is true is not certain but that’s almost irrelevant – Srdjan’s reputation for\\ninterpersonal skills was such that most people who knew him could believe it was true, so\\nhe was judged by his past record, whether or not he bad-mouthed the government official.\\nWhat’s notable is that most of those who have been on the wrong end of Srdjan’s\\nbehaviour have a very sympathetic explanation for it.\\nVojin Velickovic, the gentle, almost avuncular tennis correspondent of \\nSportski Zurnal\\n,\\nsays,\\nThe first thing to say about Srdjan is that he was a very good father. He brought his\\nthree boys up to be polite and patriotic. Srdjan was very sure Novak was going to\\nmake it and he was very angry because no one else saw it. He expected the country,\\nthe federation, everyone to help, because he saw the future in his son. But to him, it\\nseemed that no one cared until Novak became really big and that made Srdjan a bitter\\nperson, and that was the main reason for his reactions to be too furious. It’s true the\\nfederation did nothing to help him in his early years but they had no money, no\\ninterest, no ideas – they were just not able to do anything. For them, it was a big step if',\n",
       " 'they had three boxes of balls. That was fine for many players but not for the likes of\\nDjokovic, Jankovic and Ivanovic. So I understand Srdjan’s frustration, I understand his\\ncharacter. For me, he’s like a sportsman who gets angry in a game and then goes for a\\nbeer afterwards and it’s all OK – only with Srdjan, it takes a long time for it to be all\\nOK.\\nDespite the high-profile run-ins, Nebojsa Viskovic has a similar assessment.\\nHis father made him, nobody else did. Here there was no infrastructure, there was no\\nmoney, he had no help from the government, from the federation – everything was\\nfrom his family. From that point, I totally understand Srdjan but he doesn’t know how to\\ndeal with it. He can’t stop and enjoy it, he still hates everybody – he has so much hate\\ninside him. People like Novak because he represents Serbia in such a beautiful way,\\nbut his family is down in the public’s estimations because they represent Serbia in a\\nvery different way. The hate comes from the time when he was asking for money and\\nno one wanted to help. And he said, ‘OK, one day, when Novak is No. 1 in the world,\\nthen you’ll see.’ Now Novak is No. 1 – for Srdjan, it’s payback time.\\nThe Belgrade-born Viskovic throws in one other hypothesis. ‘They are from Kosovo,’ he\\nsays. ‘It’s less cosmopolitan than Belgrade, it’s \\na little less modern, and the typical family\\nfrom there is very paternalistic. Srdjan accused me because I wasn’t patriotic enough.\\nPerhaps it has to do with Kosovo. Maybe people from Belgrade are not as passionate\\nabout Serbia as the people from Kosovo are, or perhaps it seems like that to people from\\nKosovo.’\\nA common theme running through comments about the way Srdjan conducted himself is\\nthat most of the decisions he made came good. Ivan Ljubicic says, ‘Srdjan is most of the\\ntime right but the way of showing it and trying to get it is wrong. He has also changed lately\\nbut obviously his manners are what they are.’\\nBojan Bozovic was Djokovic’s doubles partner when the two were European junior\\ndoubles champions in their early teens. He believes at least part of the antipathy towards\\nSrdjan is jealousy.\\nSrdjan had a very, very tough time, in his own life and in fighting for Novak, and in\\nSerbia lots of people don’t forgive success. In Serbia there are a lot of people who\\nhaven’t been successful themselves and are jealous of others’ success. The\\nfederation didn’t help Novak when he was the best junior in Europe and Srdjan was\\nvery pissed off. Now they’re all happy to take money from his success and Srdjan\\ndoesn’t like that. Novak wants to play for his country but isn’t that bothered about the\\nfederation. Srdjan is a strong character who had a big role in Novak’s life. He gave up\\neverything so that Novak had what he needed. They sacrificed everything for Novak.\\nEveryone in the family has their own job – mother, father, Uncle Goran. Marko and\\nDjordje suffered a bit but that’s normal in any family with a gifted first child – the\\nsecond child always suffers a bit. But I liked Srdjan. He was very funny, he still is, and\\nhe had a lot of moments with my father that were very funny. But he had a goal and he\\ndidn’t care for other people – he just had a goal.\\nDejan Petrovic makes a similar point.\\nThe only thing that really concerns Srdjan is Novak, and sometimes, when you’re\\nrealistic about Novak, Srdjan doesn’t accept it. He has his own view and that’s it. He',\n",
       " 'never tried to do a Richard Williams [father of Venus and Serena Williams] and coach,\\nhe only came to three tournaments in the 10 months I worked with Novak. He would\\nask questions sometimes but he never interfered. But until he got what he wanted for\\nhis son, he would never stop. The hunger for success and always the battle – that’s\\nwhat made Novak what he is now. Serbia lacked coaching staff, so they were always\\nstriving to find someone better. Srdjan saw in me the possibility of taking Novak\\nfurther. I got on well with Novak, I knew a lot about tennis, I had great coaches myself\\nand, until then, Srdjan never left Novak’s side, he was always with him – he told me I\\nwas the only person with whom he would say, ‘Here’s my son, you can travel with\\nhim.’ I understand that at some point he would feel I had outlived my usefulness and\\nhe’d part company with me – I just don’t think it helped Novak for him to do it the way\\nhe did.\\nLadislav Kis, the other coach who ‘lost’ Djokovic thanks to Srdjan’s intervention, says,\\n‘You can say many things about Srdjan but he was good for his kid. I don’t think Srdjan\\never had any self-awareness, he never believed he’d done anything wrong. But he saw\\nvery early what Novak was and he went all the way until he got what Novak needed.\\nSrdjan also never interfered in the coaching, so I have no complaint in that regard.’\\nAnd in an era in which two of the former Yugoslavia’s six republics are members of the\\nEuropean Union and others are applying to join, it’s easy to overlook the harsh reality of\\nthe economic and political \\nsituation in which Djokovic was a teenager. ‘Srdjan was in a\\nsituation that was pretty bad,’ says Nenad Zimonjic, the veteran of Serbia’s golden\\ngeneration, who was born in 1976 so was an adult throughout the break-up of Yugoslavia.\\n‘The economy was bad, we’d had sanctions, you couldn’t get visas for certain countries. I\\nwas in a similar position as a junior. I could not really compete, I couldn’t play some junior\\nevents because I couldn’t enter the countries where they were taking place. These were\\ntough times! Srdjan was fighting to get sponsors, fighting to get attention, so when he\\nobjected to journalists not giving Novak the coverage he felt he deserved, maybe it was\\njust to get Novak more publicity, which would help get the funding. He certainly used me a\\nlot, asking my advice on things, like whether to send Novak to the Pilic academy.’\\nJelena Gencic made the point that Djokovic would never criticise his father. In public,\\nthat was true – the paternalistic nature of the Djokovic family has rubbed off on Novak to\\nthe extent that it would go totally against the grain for him to criticise his father in public.\\nAnd there is also the fact that he is intensely grateful for what his dad has done for him.\\nBut what happens behind the scenes is a different matter. It’s known that Srdjan is no fan\\nof Djokovic’s long-term girlfriend and now fiancée Jelena Ristic, yet that has never\\nundermined the relationship. So it’s quite possible Djokovic has had words in private with\\nthe family to tell his father to calm down. And on at least three occasions, he couldn’t keep\\nthem to the privacy of the family.\\nThe first came at the 2008 Australian Open, when his family were cheering a little too\\nloudly for many people’s liking. Djokovic picked up on this and muttered something to his\\nbox, after which the cheering was markedly more muted. What he said exactly, no one\\nseems to know, but it was noted for the significance of him calming the cheerleaders. The\\nsecond came just over a year later at the first Serbian Open in Belgrade. This was much\\nless subtle – in \\nfact, some say Djokovic veritably exploded at Srdjan. He certainly told him\\nin no uncertain terms to leave, an instruction witnessed by several members of the media.\\nSrdjan duly did leave and was seen strolling down the river bank a short while later,\\nsmoking a big cigar. The third came at Wimbledon in 2009 when Djokovic was playing',\n",
       " '(and losing to) Tommy Haas. Djokovic asked his complete entourage, including Srdjan, to\\nleave the players box. Only his uncle Goran returned later in the match. When asked to\\nexplain what had happened, Goran’s only comment was that this was a family matter and\\nthere was nothing to say publicly. Djokovic may well have been tacitly happy for these\\nincidents to have been witnessed but he would never say or do anything that would\\nhumiliate his father, or indeed any member of his family, in public.\\nThere’s one other person in the Srdjan Djokovic story whose role is crucial because it’s\\nso low-profile: his mother Dijana. She has not had it easy, having to play the calm rock that\\nholds the family together while her husband is often making headlines of an unwanted kind\\nin the national press. It’s not a set of circumstances that makes her role in public\\nparticularly comfortable, and she seldom speaks to the media. She made an exception on\\nher 50th birthday when she gave an interview to the Serbian newspaper \\nBlic\\n about her role\\nas a mother, but by and large she is seen, not heard.\\nDjokovic’s doubles partner from junior days, Bozan Bojovic, says, ‘Dijana is a very\\nstrong and positive woman. She looked after a lot of Novak’s behind-the-scenes stuff. She\\nhad to be very tough.’ And Dejan Petrovic says of Dijana, ‘She was a great mother. I guess\\nbeing in the house with four boys, she had to be. She was the one who made sure Novak\\nhad the right things to eat, the right clothes – in that respect she did a great job, hats off to\\nher. And the two younger brothers are good kids. It’s not easy for her but she has a very\\nstrong relationship with Novak. In fact, in some ways, Novak probably holds his parents\\ntogether.’\\nIt would be nice to feel that, at some stage, Djokovic will have achieved enough that\\nSrdjan can relax and doesn’t feel the need to exact revenge or payback on those who\\ndidn’t recognise his son’s talent many years ago. That moment ought to have come by now\\n– by September 2011 Djokovic was the runaway world No. 1 and held three of the four\\nmajor titles plus the Davis Cup. Srdjan could easily claim to have had the last laugh. Yet a\\nyear later he was in intensive care in a Belgrade hospital with a respiratory infection. For a\\nwhile the doctors struggled to diagnose his illness and for a few days his life was in\\ndanger. But he pulled through and Djokovic ended the year by beating Federer in the final\\nof the ATP World Tour Finals in London\\nMany have said Srdjan has emerged from his illness a calmer man. Maybe – he will\\nhave to be tested before we can be too sure, and remarks he made to the Serbian daily\\nKurir\\n in July 2013 suggest the fire remains undimmed (he accused Federer of trying to\\ndiscredit Djokovic and said Nadal only wanted to be friends with Djokovic while he, Nadal,\\nwas winning). Now that he has a respectable home and a comfortable mattress to sleep\\non, it would be nice to think Srdjan can enjoy the remaining years of Djokovic’s playing\\ncareer without feeling the world is his enemy, but maybe that’s just not in his character.\\nAnd for those of us who have not had to fight for everything and become as hard as nails in\\npursuit of our escape from oppression, drudgery or whatever we want to escape from, are\\nwe really entitled to condemn someone for an apparent inability to lose the mindset that\\nwas so essential to his son’s astonishing success?\\nThere is no doubt that Srdjan played the pivotal role in his son’s rise to the top. To make\\nan omelette, you have to break eggs and he was always going to break several eggs on\\nhis eventful journey. But did he really have to break so many? The question may well be\\nunfair, but it does linger after even the fairest assessment of the volatile personality of\\nSrdjan Djokovic and his so much calmer and more dignified eldest son.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER SEVEN\\nTHE MANIA BEGINS\\nT\\nhe switch of coach from Dejan Petrovic to Riccardo Piatti in July 2005 had already been\\nnegotiated by Srdjan before Djokovic left Paris for the grass of London. From the\\nperspective of the time, it was a very smart move and there was no question Djokovic was\\nwalking right into a winning culture.\\nLjubicic was having the year of his life – he’d started it by very nearly beating the\\nundisputed world No. 1 Roger Federer in three finals and had gone on to beat the US\\nDavis Cup dream team of Andre Agassi, Andy Roddick and the Bryan twins almost single-\\nhandedly in Los Angeles in the Davis Cup first round (he needed Mario Ancic’s help in the\\ndoubles but it was very much Ljubicic’s tie). In those first few months of 2005, it was easy\\nto make the case that Ljubicic was effectively the world’s second-best player behind\\nFederer.\\nAmit Naor, the Israeli agent who had signed up Djokovic, was also Ljubicic’s agent. He,\\nPiatti, Ljubicic and Djokovic all sat down and \\nworked out that they could work together. ‘I\\nnever had a problem with Riccardo working with other players,’ says Ljubicic. ‘I just don’t\\nmind it, I’ve never felt that I need a coach 24/7, I just needed certain things. The way\\nRiccardo works is not to tell you what you need to do but to explain things and get you to\\nunderstand, so there’s always a time when you need to sit back and work out all the\\ninformation and, once you understand, you are your own man, you make decisions, and\\nthat makes you a better player.’\\nIt was easy for Ljubicic to be relaxed about the arrangement because he was the senior\\nplayer. ‘It is really important within a team to know who is No. 1 priority and who is No. 2,’\\nhe says, ‘because you cannot coach two top players. The perfect combination is one top\\nplayer and then a younger player who can learn from the top guy, possibly already ranked\\nhigh enough that they can play the same tournaments, so in that case it works without any\\nproblems. It does take some understanding by the younger player.’\\nLogically all fine and dandy, but what happens when the two players come up against\\neach other? This is a perennial problem for the coaches hired by sportswear companies\\nwho suddenly find themselves with two players they coach going head-to-head – in that\\ncase, the coach generally doesn’t sit in the stadium. That was Piatti’s response when\\nLjubicic and Djokovic played each other in the Croatian capital Zagreb in February 2006.\\nHe opted to watch the match on television. It was Djokovic’s first tour-level semi-final and\\nhe took the first set on the tie-break, before losing 6–7, 6–3, 6–4. ‘I remember it was\\nmentally really difficult,’ Ljubicic recalls, ‘but at the end of the day, it’s a tennis match and\\nyou have to adapt.’\\nDjokovic spent nearly a year working with Piatti and Ljubicic. In that time he made\\nmodest progress, rising from 94 in the rankings to 63. But it was behind the scenes that a\\nlot of progress was being made that would help him later.\\nIn one of their early practice sessions, Piatti noticed something. ‘I felt he was watching\\nthe ball in a strange way,’ the Italian says. ‘I can’t remember what was strange about it but I\\nwas aware that Goran Ivanisevic had had some problems with his eyes, and when he\\nsorted them out, he won Wimbledon. So I asked Novak if he’d ever had his eyes tested. He\\nsaid he hadn’t, so I suggested that when he next went back to Serbia he get them checked',\n",
       " 'out. He did and found there was a serious problem which needed correcting.’ Since then,\\nDjokovic has worn contact lenses and occasionally some stylish glasses in off-court\\nsituations. Also early on, Ljubicic suggested to Djokovic that he change the strings he was\\nusing. He was using synthetic on both his main strings and his cross strings. Ljubicic said\\nto Djokovic, ‘Listen, all the best players except Rafa use a combination of synthetic and\\ngut!’ The Croat suggested Djokovic use a hybrid of gut and synthetic and choose a better\\nquality of synthetic string than the one he was using. Djokovic took the advice.\\nAnd in May 2006 Djokovic had a foot injury. Naor sought help from an Israeli\\nphysiotherapist Rafi Virshuvski, who in turn sounded out a contact, Tamir Kfir. Kfir is a life-\\nlong amateur tennis player who made his professional name in making orthotic insoles\\nand orthopaedic prostheses. After analysing Djokovic’s movement, Kfir decided to design\\nthree different sets of orthotics: one for grass, one for clay and one for hard courts. Given\\nthat Djokovic relies heavily on the flexibility of his ankles, in particular to play powerful\\nshots when at full-stretch (almost doing the splits) when most players would be happy just\\nto get the ball back into play, the significance of Kfir’s analysis and solution can’t be\\noverstated. After beating Roger Federer and Andy Murray in straight sets in back-to-back\\nmatches to win the 2011 Australian Open with some outstanding footwork, Djokovic threw\\nhis racket, his shirt, his socks and his shoes to the crowd – but before \\nthrowing his shoes,\\nhe took out the orthotics. When asked whether he had special insoles, he said, ‘Yes.\\nThat’s the secret to my footwork. You got me there!’\\nLjubicic recalls,\\nWhat struck me is that he really knew what he needed. He had physical needs, which\\nhe recognised. We shared a fitness coach but very quickly he figured out he needed a\\ndifferent approach to fitness work. The fitness guy we worked with, Salvador Sosa, is\\nbased on pure strength, explosive strength and power, whereas Novak always felt he\\nneeded to be more flexible, more soft, which you see on court. He was always about\\nstretching, how flexible he is, and Sosa wasn’t working like that. I think he was really\\nmature really soon. I think every tennis player reaches the moment where he becomes\\na man and, to him, it happened really quickly. With me, it happened when I was 23 or\\n24, with him it happened when he was 17 or 18, which is why he went up so quickly.\\nHe wasn’t really a joker. He wanted to become as good as he can. Once he realised\\nwho he really is and he was going in the right direction, he relaxed more and let go\\nmore that side, which is his personality. But when he was younger, he was more\\nprofessional in the sense that he wouldn’t waste time on unnecessary things. He was\\n100 per cent focused on what he wanted to do.\\nPiatti says, ‘It was very easy to see the potential. When we started working, I noted his\\nflexibility, his attitude on court, his technique, his mentality. He was so focused and so\\ndetermined. Yes, he was young but in some ways very mature. He was also ready for the\\ntop level. Technically he was ready, physically he was good. I felt sure he was a No. 1 of\\nthe future; his parents had built him in the correct way for that role.’\\nSuch determination and focus is all well and good but it still needs to be channelled in\\nthe right direction. Ljubicic believes Piatti did that channelling. ‘Riccardo helped Novak\\ngrow up. There were moments when he was lost. Now that he’s king of the world, it looks\\nlike he always knew what he was doing but, back then, it wasn’t really like that. He was a\\ncharacter. He travelled with a friend to Australia and Riccardo said maybe that was not the\\nright thing to do. That was Riccardo’s way; he tried to think what was right for Novak.\\nNovak was 18, he had to explore the world, but it didn’t take him long to work it out. I think',\n",
       " 'he learned about himself. He learned more and more what he needed, he gained from the\\nexperience of being close to a top player, because I was No. 3 in the world at that time, so\\nhe could see what was needed to get there. He never needed to talk about forehands and\\nbackhands, though we did work a lot on his serve – he wasn’t really using his serve and,\\nwhile we were working together, Riccardo and I were giving him tips.’\\nThe link with Ljubicic is an interesting one for the subject of nationality. In 2005 Ljubicic\\ncemented his place as a national sporting icon for the new Balkan state of Croatia, when\\nhe won a record 11 out of 12 Davis Cup matches (seven out of eight in singles) to bring\\nCroatia the title. Djokovic’s equally impressive singles record when Serbia won the Davis\\nCup in 2010 can be put neatly alongside Ljubicic’s achievement. Indeed, the two friends\\nhave arguably done more to put Croatia and Serbia on the map than any of their\\ncompatriots (with the possible exception of Croatia finishing third in the 1998 football World\\nCup). But one other thing binds them – they were both sounded out about playing for a\\ndifferent country.\\nLjubicic escaped the carnage of the disintegrating Yugoslavia, fleeing his home in the\\nBosnian town of Banja Luka and spending time in war-torn Zagreb before fleeing to the\\nsafety of a family in \\nItaly willing to provide shelter to a gifted young tennis player. A\\nBosnian Croat, Ljubicic could have opted for Bosnian or Croatian citizenship but, after five\\nyears residency in Italy, he would have had the option of playing for Italy. Because the club\\nwhere he played cancelled his residency card when he left after three years, the option\\nnever materialised, although Ljubicic did play under the Italian flag when entered for\\ntournaments by his club. He says today, ‘At some point I would probably have had a\\nchance to decide if I wanted to become Italian, but the truth is I don’t really think I would\\nhave done it.’\\nDjokovic’s offer appears to have been much more concrete. In April 2006 Serbia &\\nMontenegro, the last two remaining states of the former Yugoslavia which had given up the\\nname ‘Yugoslavia’ in 2003, beat Great Britain in a Euro-African zone Davis Cup tie in\\nGlasgow. Shortly after, it emerged that negotiations had taken place between the Djokovic\\nfamily and the British tennis authorities during the tie about the possibility that the three\\nDjokovic boys might qualify for residency and thus play Davis Cup for Great Britain. Details\\nof the negotiations are sketchy and it’s not known who approached who. A spokesperson\\nfor the Lawn Tennis Association (the British national tennis governing body is the only one\\nin the world that does not have the country’s name in its title!) said at the time that Dijana\\nhad approached the LTA, while it is generally accepted that the LTA offered the Djokovic\\nfamily a lot of money to switch to Great Britain.\\nIt’s important to understand the background for both sides. The British were facing\\nanother potentially humiliating situation in which they had the most prestigious tennis\\ntournament in the world, which gifted a surplus of £25–30 million a year to the LTA, but no\\nplayers to challenge for the title. They had enjoyed the Henman-Rusedski era. Both Tim\\nHenman and Greg Rusedski had reached fourth in the world rankings at their respective\\npeaks but \\nboth were in the twilight of their careers and, while there was a promising\\nScottish boy called Andy Murray on the horizon, there were (and are) no shortage of\\npromising British juniors who never make the transition to the full tour. There had been a\\nlot of fuss among British tennis traditionalists when Rusedski switched from Canada to\\nGreat Britain in May 1995, but it became muted fairly quickly (especially after he reached\\nthe US Open final in September 1997). Rusedski had clearly been of massive value to the\\nLTA in helping to promote tennis to British youngsters and the British public, and his rivalry\\nwith Henman probably made both of them into more successful players than they would',\n",
       " 'have been ploughing a lone furrow. Therefore, offering a sizeable sum to a player who\\ncould play the same mutually beneficial role with Andy Murray as Rusedski had played\\nwith Henman must have looked like good business for the affluent LTA.\\nFrom the Djokovic family’s perspective, it was a lucrative offer. Serbia had no tennis\\ntradition, the country had shrunk from the six-state Yugoslavia to the two-state Serbia &\\nMontenegro, and was about to lose Montenegro whose citizens had voted to secede.\\nSrdjan had been knocking on doors for several years looking for funding and had come up\\nwith considerably more rejections than expressions of interest. Under International Tennis\\nFederation rules (the ITF owns and runs the Davis Cup), living on British soil for three\\nyears would have been sufficient for Djokovic to play Davis Cup for Great Britain, even if\\nthe family hadn’t got British citizenship, and that qualifying period might have been even\\nshorter if someone could have successfully argued that the break-up of Yugoslavia meant\\nthe country Djokovic was born in no longer existed. So the offer of funding and practice\\nfacilities in a mature tennis country must have been attractive.\\nBut by then, Djokovic already had his contract with Amit Naor and Allon Khakshourian,\\nso the financial need was no longer quite \\nas pressing. In addition, the family had\\nabsolutely no connection with Great Britain. There was no emotional pull to Britain the way\\nthere had been with Rusedski, whose mother had lived the first six years of her life in the\\nYorkshire town of Dewsbury, and Rusedski himself had a British passport and had been\\nliving in south London for several years before opting to play for Great Britain. In the end,\\nthe offer was politely and quietly declined.\\nThe offer to play for Great Britain may seem a small detail in Djokovic’s career, even a\\npedantic one – after all, there are lots of people who could opt for different nationalities on\\nthe basis of parentage, grandparentage or residency, and Djokovic himself could have\\nplayed for Serbia, Montenegro or Croatia. But it’s important for Djokovic’s status as\\nnational icon. If he went actively seeking a different nationality, that would surely\\nundermine his credibility as a Serbian flag-carrier. Yet all the evidence suggests that he\\nlistened to the offer but never really wanted it.\\nSpeaking to the British tennis journalist Neil Harman in 2009, Djokovic said,\\nBritain was offering me a lot of opportunities and they needed someone because Andy\\n[Murray] was the only one, and still is. That had to be a disappointment for all the\\nmoney they invest. But I didn’t need the money as much as I had done. I had begun to\\nmake some for myself, enough to afford to travel with a coach, and I said, ‘Why the\\nheck?’ I am Serbian, I am proud of being a Serbian – I didn’t want to spoil that just\\nbecause another country had better conditions. If I had played for Great Britain, of\\ncourse I would have played exactly as I do for my country but, deep inside, I would\\nnever have felt that I belonged. I was the one who took the decision.\\nAll of which rings true except that last part – Srdjan is likely to have \\nhad the lion’s share of\\nthe decision to reject the offer, as Novak’s move towards greater independence from his\\nfather came later (even as late as January 2007 Srdjan only allowed Djokovic a credit\\ncard, not a cash allowance, so he could monitor his son’s spending).\\nDjokovic’s first touring coach, Dejan Petrovic, who was still Serbia’s Davis Cup captain\\nat the time of the offer and who has dual Serbian and Australian nationality himself,\\nbelieves the finances and functionality of the British approach could never replace the\\nemotional pull of Djokovic’s Serbian nationality. ‘The LTA made a big offer,’ he says, ‘and\\nthe family thought about it very seriously. It was very attractive and I’m very happy he didn’t\\naccept it. Novak being who he is, he’s very patriotic. From the 10 months I was travelling',\n",
       " 'with him, I know how much Serbia means to him. After winning the first Australian Open [in\\n2008], he stood up on the balcony of the city hall in Belgrade to wave to thousands of well-\\nwishers who had turned up on a cold winter’s morning, and I remember him telling me that\\nwas the ultimate for a sports person. He could never have had that as a Briton.’\\nA trawl through the newspaper reports of the time suggests Djokovic had been saying\\nbehind the scenes that he was considering the possibility of a move. But the British press\\ndoesn’t have the most reliable record for accuracy and frequently bases stories on rumour\\nand is thus vulnerable to leading figures and their spin doctors floating ideas through the\\npress. More importantly, Djokovic was well aware of all the sacrifices his family had made\\nfor him, so he probably felt it his duty to at least listen to what was on offer. Had the offer\\ncome a year earlier, who knows what he would have done, but both he and Srdjan were\\nultimately against it.\\nNenad Zimonjic, who was the senior professional in the Serbian team that played in\\nGlasgow, believes the LTA’s offer may have been engineered by the Djokovic family.\\n‘Maybe it was a way of saying to our country, “Listen, you have an unbelievable talent\\nhere, you \\nshould help it.” He used it as a lever, perhaps. And that’s OK – deep down, I\\ndon’t think he was thinking of taking different citizenship but I think he was expecting more\\nsupport from his country, certainly more than he was getting at that time. He had\\nunbelievable support from the people but the Serbian association didn’t help him. In\\nfairness, it didn’t have much to help him with – I had to fund all my own travel.’\\nThe most likely explanation is that the family’s attraction to the offer was based on what it\\nwould offer the younger boys, Marko and Djordje. They were both gifted tennis players,\\nalbeit not in Novak’s league, but Srdjan had made it clear that he couldn’t handle more\\nthan one world-beating prodigy in the family. Therefore, if Marko and Djordje were to get\\nany chance of making it as tennis professionals, they would need some help from outside\\nthe family, the kind of help that just wouldn’t have come from Serbia. It’s interesting that the\\napproach to the LTA is reported to have come from Dijana – as most of Srdjan’s efforts\\nwere directed towards Novak, it was left to Dijana to make sure the couple’s second and\\nthird sons weren’t left out, so the family’s motivation might well have been based on them,\\nrather than Novak. Only when the story of family conversations round the dinner table is\\nrevealed will we know the answer.\\nWith the benefit of hindsight, the decision to remain Serbian was a good one. While\\nDjokovic was the youngest player in the world’s top 70 at the time the negotiations in\\nGlasgow took place, there was no guarantee that he would scale the heights he has since\\nscaled. To that extent the decision was a brave one and leaves his standing as a national\\nicon for the nation of Serbia well and truly intact.\\n \\nBy the end of 2005, Djokovic was making sufficient progress that the equilibrium Ivan\\nLjubicic speaks of – between the top player and the younger No. 2 who is learning from the\\nmore established \\nprofessional – was beginning to creak. Piatti was always clear that\\nLjubicic was the top priority, and Djokovic was beginning to feel he needed a coach who\\nwas focused solely on him.\\nThe first friction came at the last regular tour event of the year, the Paris Masters, when\\nSrdjan approached Piatti and said he wanted the Italian to devote more time to Djokovic.\\nPiatti said Djokovic would be a great player to coach, but his priority was Ljubicic who was\\nat the peak of his career. That was effectively the beginning of the end because Srdjan\\nwas, from then on, on the lookout for a new coach. ‘I saw Novak was not happy with me,’\\nPiatti says, ‘but I was with Ivan and he was No. 3. I didn’t want Novak to lose time, so I fully',\n",
       " 'accepted his wish to find his own coach. I’ve been in tennis for 30 years and he’s the best\\nplayer I’ve worked with. It was an unbelievable opportunity to work with him.’ Djokovic\\nstayed on for another six months, but after the Rome Masters of May 2006 he broke from\\nthe Piatti-Ljubicic stable.\\nLjubicic recognised Djokovic’s needs too, and when the split came, it was entirely\\namicable – Ljubicic and Djokovic have not only remained good friends but they talk with\\neach other several times a week. And their friendship can survive a lot of ribbing. At a\\nparticularly stressful meeting of the players at the 2007 Australian Open, when the subject\\nof anti-doping measures was occupying everyone’s minds, Djokovic broke some of the ice\\nwhen he complemented Ljubicic on an incisive question and suggested his bald-headed\\nfriend be given a bottle of shampoo as the prize for the best question.\\nDjokovic’s run to the French Open quarter-final in May 2006, where he retired with\\nbreathing problems against Rafael Nadal after losing the second set, took him into the\\nworld’s top 50 and further emphasised the need for an individual coach. Interestingly,\\nDjokovic received a phone call from the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav \\nKostunica to\\ncongratulate him on his achievement – it’s easy to forget now just how big it was for Serbia\\nto have a Grand Slam quarter-finalist in those days.\\nIn the run-up to the French Open, Djokovic’s agent presented him with a list of several\\npossible coaches. One of the names on the list was Marian Vajda, a Slovak born in 1965\\nwho had reached 34th in the rankings in 1987 and had won a couple of rounds at the 1991\\nFrench Open. He had gone on to coach the Slovak Davis and Fed Cup teams, and various\\nindividual players. His last one was his fellow Slovak Karol Kucera, who had retired after\\nlosing to Ljubicic in the 2005 Davis Cup final, so Vajda was a free agent. Djokovic picked\\nhis name off the list and asked to meet him.\\nVajda tells the story that he was in two minds about whether to make the trip to Paris to\\nmeet Djokovic and his entourage but was persuaded to do so by his 10-year-old daughter\\nNatalia, who was a keen tennis player herself (she has since competed on the junior\\nGrand Slam circuit – as a woman, her surname is Vajdova). The two hit it off and thus\\nbegan one of the most enduring player/coach relationships in modern tennis history.\\nVajda got a sense of the potential and the challenge within a few weeks. After reaching\\nthe fourth round at Wimbledon, where he lost to Mario Ancic, Djokovic won the title on the\\nDutch clay of Amersfoort and then went to Croatia to play in the holiday resort of Umag. He\\nreached the final on his ninth consecutive victory since Wimbledon but retired with\\nbreathing problems in the first set tie-break, gifting his opponent Stanislas Wawrinka with\\nhis first tour title. Whatever the tennis world may have made of it, it was pure melodrama.\\nDjokovic paused several times to get his breath back during the first set, he sought medical\\nadvice at the start of the tie-break and had to be held around the chest to help him to\\nbreathe normally. After four points of the tie-break – and leading 3–1 – he suddenly fell to\\nthe ground and lay motionless. His father and a \\ndoctor ran out, checked him out and\\ncarried him to his courtside chair while his Croatian mother sat weeping in the stands. The\\ncrowd bore him no malice, warmly applauding the apology he made in his presentation\\nceremony speech. After all, he was half-Croatian and the first set had lasted 73 minutes,\\nlonger than some finals that are won decisively in straight sets.\\nThe Davis Cup tie in September 2006 against Switzerland in Geneva was one of the first\\nindications of some of the sideshows that were to accompany Djokovic for the next few\\nyears. It was Serbia’s first attempt at reaching the competition’s elite 16-nation World\\nGroup (you can’t win the Davis Cup if you aren’t in the World Group). It was only the\\nsecond time Djokovic had come up against the runaway world No. 1 Roger Federer and it',\n",
       " 'was the first time Srdjan got involved publicly in a matter that impacted on his son. In the\\nrun-up to that tie, Srdjan made some comments in the Serbian press denigrating Federer.\\nMost of it could be put down to the kind of kidology that characterises the build-up to all\\nsorts of one-to-one sporting contests, but it probably added a little to Federer’s keenness,\\nespecially as the Swiss maestro had by then rather lost the appetite for winning the Davis\\nCup and had begun to view the competition as a set of isolated weekends that he could\\ntake or leave as a way of spending a bit of time with his tennis mates, rather than as a\\nseries of ties leading to one of the most prestigious trophies in tennis.\\nAfter Federer beat Tipsarevic in straight sets in the opening match, Djokovic went two\\nsets to one down against Stanislas Wawrinka in the second singles. If Serbia had lost that\\none, the tie would have been lost on the opening day, but Djokovic came back, winning the\\nfourth set on a 7–3 tie-break and the fifth 6–4. Yet on several occasions he called for the\\ntrainer, which severely angered Federer. With Federer and his former flatmate Yves\\nAllegro winning the doubles in straight sets over Zimonjic and Ilija Bozoljac, everything\\nwas set for Federer to play Djokovic in the first reverse singles. Federer was clearly\\npumped, and while the result might have been the same even if he hadn’t been because\\nhe had the ability to play sparkling tennis whatever the circumstances, this was a rare\\noccasion for Federer when it was personal. Djokovic won just eight games and was the\\nsubject of Federer’s ‘he’s a joke’ tirade in the post-match media sessions (the full story is\\non page 166).\\nIn retrospect, that tie was the last of an era for Djokovic and his country. It was the last tie\\ncontested by Serbia & Montenegro – henceforth, it was to be just Serbia. By the time\\nSerbia played again seven months later, Djokovic was a top-10 player and the\\nexpectations were massive. It’s also interesting to note that the team that played\\nSwitzerland in September 2006 was the exact same team that saw Serbia to the final\\nagainst Canada in September 2013 – in essence, Serbia has used just five players in its\\nrise to the top of the team-tennis standings: Djokovic, Tipsarevic, Troicki, Zimonjic and\\nBozoljac. Sometimes having a small nation with not a great pool of players to choose from\\ncan deliver a settled squad that doesn’t happen when there’s a greater pool of riches.\\n \\nFrom Federer’s tongue-lashing in Geneva, Djokovic moved on to Metz, where he won the\\ntournament and with it acceded to the world’s top 20. He was a quarter-finalist at the indoor\\nMadrid Masters, a tournament that allowed him to mend some fences with Federer, and he\\nfinished the year ranked 16. He picked up another title in Adelaide (the one Dejan Petrovic\\nhad tried to get him a wildcard for three years earlier) but then came up against Federer in\\nthe fourth round of the Australian Open. Although hyped by the media as a grudge match,\\nFederer’s only concern was to show that he hadn’t beaten Djokovic on anger in Geneva,\\nand he posted another straight-sets win, Djokovic this time winning 10 games.\\nThere are various points where the Djokovic story shifts into a \\nnew gear and the two\\nAmerican hard-court Masters Series tournaments in March 2007 were clearly one such\\npoint. ‘The whole mania began in 2007 when Novak won in Miami,’ says Nenad Zimonjic.\\n‘It created such interest at home that, within a few months, we had the [Davis Cup] tie\\nagainst Australia when 19,000 people came – when we won that tie, we qualified for the\\nWorld Group. For me personally, starting from the bottom, from the fifth group, to go through\\na couple of different generations and now to have the opportunity to win the Davis Cup in\\nfront of your own crowd, it was incredible.’\\nAt Indian Wells in the California desert, Djokovic beat Andy Murray in the semi-finals to\\nset up a final against Rafael Nadal. Nadal beat him 6–2, 7–5, but when the two met in the',\n",
       " 'quarter-finals in Miami 11 days later, Djokovic notched up his first-ever win against Nadal,\\n6–3, 6–4. He went on to beat Murray and the wily Argentinean veteran Guillermo Canas to\\ntake the title. That took him into the world’s top 10, and when he went to Belgrade for his\\nnext official match, the Davis Cup tie against Georgia, he was ranked No. 7.\\nThis period in Djokovic’s rise is marked by the first of his forays into seeking outside\\nhelp. He had been working with Marian Vajda for eight months when the two men – plus\\nSrdjan – felt Djokovic needed some additional guidance on getting to the net. There was\\nnot a lot wrong with his volleys, but playing an aggressive game of tennis is not just about\\nbeing willing to go to the net, it’s also about going there at the right time and with the right\\napproach shot.\\nThey looked at a number of possible people to come in and help but eventually alighted\\non Mark Woodforde. The softly spoken South Australian is known as a doubles specialist\\nbecause of his record-breaking partnership with Todd Woodbridge, but Woodforde had\\nbeen a distinguished singles player – he reached the Australian Open semi-finals in 1996,\\noften beating more powerful \\nplayers by getting his tactics right at the right time. Woodforde\\nwas a contemporary of Vajda and they had played against each other a few times, so his\\nfirst thought on being approached by Djokovic’s co-agent Allon Khakshourian was about\\nwhere Vajda fitted into the picture if Woodforde was being summoned.\\n‘I said to Marian the first time we sat down that I’d be uncomfortable if he wasn’t on board\\nwith this,’ Woodforde says. ‘I said it has to be an association, I wanted to make sure he\\nwas comfortable with what we were trying to achieve. Khakshourian had explained that\\nMarian was going to be there, Marian confirmed that he was still the coach but was worried\\nthat that transition from baseline to net was a vital part of Novak’s game that he wasn’t\\nconsciously able to call on and bring it into play when he needed to, so they wanted my\\nhelp to work with Marian. I was cool with that. I just had no idea at the time about the strong\\ninfluence that Srdjan had.’\\nWoodforde joined the Djokovic set-up in March 2007, just before the tournament in\\nIndian Wells. The Australian remembers the impression Djokovic created from the first day.\\n‘He was like a sponge,’ Woodforde says. ‘He had a thirst for information. He was never shy\\nabout stopping and asking someone. Srdjan understood that if you could take little things\\nfrom people along the way, you’d build what you need. You have to give him [Srdjan]\\ncredit. The goal was to be No. 1 – it was so overpowering, it really shocked me, and\\npicking up things along the way was all part of attaining the goal. Whilst it was nice to be\\ntapped – and I did have the experience of being a pretty decent volleyer in my time – I was\\nwell aware I wasn’t the only person he was seeking advice from.’\\nOff court, Djokovic had elements of the fun teenager (he turned 20 during Woodforde’s\\nfour months working with him). ‘He enjoyed night time,’ Woodforde recalls.\\nHe let his hair down in the evening. I could see he was heading in such a strong and\\nhealthy direction but I think we all have our moments. He was always on a quest to get\\nfitter, stronger and to outlast Roger and Rafa – not just to compete with them but to\\noutlast them, but there were a couple of nights in our time when he did enjoy himself. I\\nwasn’t a clubbing person even when I played but I went out with him a couple of times\\nand he loved the fact that people recognised him – he kind of revelled in that. He wore\\nhis glasses once or twice and he looked really stylish in them. I once asked him, ‘What\\nare you – half-blind or something?’ And he said, ‘No, but they look good, don’t they?’ I\\nthought they looked very scholarly.\\nWoodforde had very little to do with Srdjan, largely because he didn’t speak much English.',\n",
       " 'When he was around, he would talk with his son in Serbian and with Vajda in a mixture of\\nSerbian and Slovak. ‘Dijana was much more comfortable with her English,’ Woodforde\\nsays, ‘and I was struck by Nole’s very impressive command of the English language. He’s\\nobviously a very smart guy.’\\nDjokovic had come to realise that he couldn’t beat Federer and Nadal solely from the\\nbaseline – he had to use his net game more. Yet Vajda explained to Woodforde that\\nDjokovic would come to the net, get passed once or twice and say, ‘I’m not going there\\nagain.’ It wasn’t just hitting the volley that was the problem but the movement forward, the\\npositioning, picking the right time to go in. The Djokovic camp appeared to be gearing up\\nfor the short but prestigious grass-court season, albeit making some adjustments on hard\\nand clay along the way.\\nWoodforde says, ‘I felt he was capable at the net but I wasn’t a fan of his backhand\\nvolley. There were little details. He would come in willy-nilly at times, so we sat down and\\ntalked, not just about being on the court but how he felt about coming to the net. If you \\ndon’t\\nenjoy coming to the net, you’re not going to do it successfully when you need it.’\\nResults-wise, the period after Woodforde joined the team was a dream. The run to the\\nIndian Wells final, the victory over Nadal in Miami, which was of huge psychological\\nsignificance – OK, so it was on Nadal’s least favourite surface, but Nadal had beaten\\nFederer in Miami a couple of years earlier, so it was a genuinely morale-boosting result –\\nthen the title in Miami, a hero’s welcome at home in Davis Cup and a title on clay in Estoril.\\nThings were going so well that Khakshourian sounded out Woodforde to ask if he would\\nbe willing to spend increasing amounts of time with Djokovic.\\nBut Djokovic’s run of victories presented problems, as all players face when they get on\\na productive run of form. Players, male and female, plan their schedule based on hoping to\\nplay around 60–70 matches a year; so if they expect to play an average of three matches\\nper tournament, they will enter around 20 events. But if they then find they win back-to-\\nback tournaments, the schedule becomes unsuitable and counterproductive, but by then\\nthe player has committed to the tournaments and can’t pull out without incurring a fine\\n(unless they have an injury, or a doctor who’ll say they have an injury).\\nIt meant Djokovic approached the most intense period of the tennis year – the French\\nOpen and Wimbledon period – with his body starting to show signs of the physical\\nbattering it had taken. Woodforde says,\\nEverything Novak did was in comparison to Rafa and Roger. He’d been experiencing\\nall these great results in the Slams but he was breaking down in the quarters and the\\nsemis; physically, he was not at the same level from day one. So he was asking the\\nquestions: how can they last five sets? How can they back up after a punishing\\nmatch? How can they sustain their fitness through a two-week tournament? He was\\nstarting to realise he needed to spend more time on the physical but he had put in a lot\\nof work in the run-up to the French Open and then he got to the semi-finals, so he was\\npretty fatigued by the time he lost to Rafa in Paris. All this time, I’m trying to get him to\\nwork on new skills on the practice court, but it’s hard to pull the guy on to the court to\\nget him to do another hour or two hours of work when he’s very tired from his run of\\nmatches.\\nDjokovic and his camp wanted to take the week after the French off and then play a lower-\\nranking grass-court tournament the week before Wimbledon. Woodforde persuaded him to\\ngo to London, play his scheduled tournament at the Queen’s Club and then take the week\\nbefore Wimbledon off. The thinking was that he’d be tired either way but, by playing',\n",
       " 'Queen’s, he would get some decent matches on grass and then rest before Wimbledon.\\nUnfortunately, it didn’t work out that way. Although Djokovic only played two matches,\\nlosing to Arnaud Clement, who was a much better grass player than he was ever given\\ncredit for, there was a lot of rain, so it took five days to get through the tournament. He then\\nroused himself for Wimbledon, got through to the semi-finals but in a series of marathons\\nthat saw him play nine tie-breaks in four matches, leaving him as dead meat against Nadal\\nin the semis (the story of how he very nearly pulled out of that match because of the\\ninflamed toe that was the legacy of all his marathon matches is told on page 171).\\nIt had been a great four months since the start of Indian Wells, and at the end of\\nWimbledon, Woodforde was approached about working with Djokovic for another couple\\nof months, at least until the end of the US Open. But it never happened. Woodforde was\\nback at home in the USA and could sense there was some hesitation \\nfrom Djokovic’s\\nagents. Most of the top players take at least three weeks off after Wimbledon before\\nreturning on the North American hard courts, but Djokovic had committed to playing in\\nUmag, Croatia, and didn’t want to pull out of the tournament in the country of his mother’s\\nethnicity, especially after being given a wildcard. In the second round, he lost to Viktor\\nTroicki on a 7–5 final set. As the match wore on, the tiredness caught up with Djokovic. He\\nwent to the net more and more recklessly to keep the points short and was eventually\\npicked off by his fellow Serb.\\n‘I was led to believe that Srdjan was irate that he’d lost,’ says Woodforde\\nphilosophically, ‘and wanted to know why Novak was going to the net recklessly.’\\nThis wasn’t part of the plan but it makes sense – when you’re tired, you don’t try to\\nelongate the points, you try to shorten them, so he had this desire to rush to the net\\nand was exposed. I was the guy who was brought in to help him get to the net and this\\nhappened. Suddenly, I got a message from the agent saying, ‘Thanks, we think we’ve\\ngot what we needed,’ and that was the end of it. These days I see him going to the net\\nat the right time, and I know I was part of that. I don’t look at him and say, ‘That was\\nme,’ because I was one of many who helped him. But the end seemed odd – it was\\ncertainly abrupt and I think Srdjan directed the whole scenario at the end. I wish I’d got\\nmore court time but I was aware of the accumulated workload he’d had at that time\\nand I didn’t want to overdo it. Looking back, if I’d had a bit more court time, would it\\nhave happened sooner? You never know.\\nWoodforde also notes that Djokovic was ‘always after information to make him a better\\nplayer’ and Djokovic sought his next outside information from one of the greatest names in\\ntennis, John \\nMcEnroe. In the three subsequent tournaments he played – Montreal,\\nCincinnati and the US Open – McEnroe helped with advice on volleys. And again the\\nresults were good.\\nHe won the Masters Series title in Montreal, with a run-in of Roddick in the quarter-finals,\\nNadal in the semis and Federer in the final – that final was his first victory over Federer and\\na psychological milestone over the newly crowned Wimbledon champion (for the fifth time).\\nAfter losing to Carlos Moya in Cincinnati, Djokovic then had a reasonable draw at the US\\nOpen. He beat Moya in the quarters, then in the semis, instead of coming up against\\nNadal, he beat David Ferrer, the man who had beaten Nadal in the fourth round (at that\\nstage in his career, Nadal was known for running out of steam on the North American hard-\\ncourt swing). His straight-sets victory over Ferrer took him into his first major final, where\\nFederer awaited him. So did Maria Sharapova and Robert de Niro, who were in the crowd\\ncheering for the 20-year-old newcomer.',\n",
       " 'A more experienced Djokovic would probably have beaten Federer that day. The Swiss\\nwas, in theory, at the peak of his career, going for a third major in a year for the third time,\\nundisputed as the world’s best player and already being talked about as arguably the\\ngreatest of all time. But he was looking vulnerable. Many were shocked when he was\\ntaken to five sets by Nadal in the Wimbledon final and some of the confidence was missing\\nfrom Federer’s game in the US final. His forehand was all over the place in the first set, in\\nparticular when Djokovic broke him to lead 6–5 and 40–0. But Djokovic, who’d had two set\\npoints at 5–4, missed five more and double-faulted on Federer’s first set point in the tie-\\nbreak. Djokovic had two set points at 6–5 in the second set but lost the set on a second tie-\\nbreak. Djokovic had chances in the third but, by then, Federer was away, Djokovic was\\nlooking increasingly ragged, and Federer ran out the winner in straight sets.\\nMany were saying after that final that Djokovic had shown he wasn’t up to taking his\\nopportunities when they presented themselves. That was a bit harsh for a man in his first\\nGrand Slam final and still only 20 years of age. But when Federer admitted after the match\\nthat he had been nervous because of a stomach upset that had left him with ‘nervous\\nshaking and cold hands’ before the final, it did seem as if a rare opportunity to beat the\\nGrand Master had been offered and declined.\\nFederer revealed later that, in the two men’s chit-chat at the net after the match, he had\\ntold Djokovic to ‘keep it up’ and that the two men would have lots more battles in the future.\\nThey were to meet in another major just four months later, and Djokovic was to show that\\nhe had indeed learned something from his US Open missed opportunity.\\n \\nIt was around the middle of 2007 that Djokovic made a name for himself in a way that he\\nhas slightly struggled with since. Though a very serious and studious man on the court, he\\nhas a great sense of fun off it and is clearly a very sharp observer of people. He must also\\nhave some innate acting ability because it emerged that he was highly proficient at\\nimpersonating other tennis players.\\nLike the best comedians and impressionists, he had a few classic acts with which he\\nbuilt a reputation, and they really were very good. A BBC camera caught him doing Maria\\nSharapova, Rafael Nadal, Goran Ivanisevic and Lleyton Hewitt on a practice court at\\nLondon’s Queen’s Club just before the 2007 Wimbledon championships, after which word\\ngot around. His highest-profile performance came after beating Carlos Moya in the 2007\\nUS Open quarter-finals, when the on-court interviewer asked him to do some impressions.\\nWith the crowd still in good number, Djokovic offered them Maria Sharapova, Rafael Nadal\\nand Andy Roddick, and brought the house down. But perhaps the more revealing footage\\nis \\na private video that made its way to YouTube, which shows Djokovic doing a handful of\\nimpressions in the men’s locker room. Some of the players he impersonates are not\\nhousehold names, so the impersonations would be lost on all but players and tour\\ngroupies, but the attention to detail is remarkable. Like the best cartoonists, he takes a\\ngesture or nervous tic and exaggerates it, which sometimes creates a very different\\nimpression of the person being impersonated. His impersonation of Roger Federer\\noverdoes the effeminate gestures that are part of Federer’s on-court persona but the overall\\nsense is still very much that this is Roger Federer he’s portraying.\\nAfter doing his Sharapova impression at the 2008 Australian Open, Djokovic rather shut\\ndown the show. ‘I was serving at 4–4, 30–30 in an important match,’ he told CBS\\ntelevision, ‘and a guy goes, “Hey, Novak, do the impersonation of Sharapova, we like that,\\nmake us laugh.”’ That sent a message that the sideshow was threatening to usurp the main\\nact. He also said he had received some bad responses from his fellow professionals and',\n",
       " 'he didn’t want unease in the locker rooms and player lounges. He admits that Rafael\\nNadal was offended when he did the tugging-at-the-underpants gesture Nadal seems\\nunable to shake off. Of course, Nadal won’t thank anyone for making fun of him, but he is\\nknown on the tour as a bit of a practical joker himself and he’s able to laugh about it, as he\\nhad to on the podium after beating Djokovic in the 2009 Rome Masters final – Djokovic, the\\nloser, was asked to imitate Nadal after both men had received their trophies; Djokovic\\nobliged but was clearly embarrassed to be doing so in front of Nadal. Djokovic has said\\npublicly he doesn’t want to offend Nadal twice.\\nThe impersonations may have an important role to play as a form of release for Djokovic.\\n‘He’s very serious when he comes to tennis,’ says his former coach, the Australian-raised\\nDejan Petrovic, ‘but he’s not the type to be serious all the time. It’s in his \\nblood that he likes\\nto joke. That’s a bit of the Serbian mentality – we Serbians like to joke a lot. He possesses\\nsomething phenomenal, that when it’s on a tennis court in a match, he’s serious 100 per\\ncent – not one thing enters his mind but winning the match. With him, the mind just doesn’t\\nwander.’ And the Serbian tennis commentator Nebojsa Viskovic says, ‘He needs the\\njokes, it’s his release valve.’ One could equally argue that the increasingly baseline-\\norientated sport of tennis needs the parallel humour of seeing a top player’s sense of fun.\\nDjokovic says today, ‘I felt that it became too forced at times – people would force me to\\ndo it when I didn’t quite feel like it. I was doing those impersonations on practice courts at\\nfirst, at the end of my training sessions. It was a way to relax and have fun and entertain the\\ncrowd that came to watch me. The word spread and all of a sudden they asked me to do it\\nin front of the cameras on stadiums. The first couple of times it was fun, but then it started\\nbeing too forced and I just didn’t want to do it any more. And I didn’t want to have people\\nguessing if I am offending someone or not, because that was never the motive behind it.\\nI’m glad my colleagues got that part right and joked with me.’\\nPerhaps a feeling that he’d got his message across allowed him to resume the act when\\nthe mood took him. Certainly, by 2013 his willingness to do the impersonations was\\nreturning. He did Sharapova at a pre-Wimbledon exhibition tournament, an act that had\\nextra spice given that he did it during a match against Grigor Dimitrov, the Bulgarian who\\nhad just begun dating Sharapova. Dimitrov loved it but Sharapova admonished Djokovic\\ngently in her pre-Wimbledon press conference, saying she had eliminated many of the\\ngestures that were the staple of his impersonation. That’s obviously the problem – his\\nimitation makes a player aware of their tics, which prompts the player (well, some players)\\nto eradicate them.\\nGiven the following the former Iranian professional Mansour Bahrami developed on the\\nseniors’ tour for his impressions of John McEnroe, Boris Becker and others, there will\\nalways be a market for Djokovic’s impersonations, certainly when he retires from top-level\\ntennis. But his strict demarcation of business and pleasure means there will always be\\nlimited scope in his schedule for performing them.\\n \\nThe victory over Georgia in April had taken Serbia into the playoff round for the Davis Cup\\nWorld Group for the second year running. But this time the Serbs were drawn at home\\nagainst Australia, for whom Lleyton Hewitt was still the leading player. This tie, in effect,\\nmarked the birth of Serbia as a modern Davis Cup powerhouse, not because the Serbs\\nwere particularly dominant against Australia but because they discovered a venue that\\nbecame not just their default venue for big home ties but their spiritual home.\\nDjokovic’s victory in Miami in early April had created a massive burst of interest, so\\nfaced with a home tie to get into the World Group, the Serbian Tennis Federation opted for',\n",
       " 'the Beogradska Arena (Belgrade Arena), a new venue whose troubled construction history\\nreflected the rollercoaster ride that Serbia as a country and Serbia’s players as individuals\\nhad all been through. It was a gamble because the capacity for basketball was 20,000 and\\nfor tennis it would be very close to that. Having played in front of just a few thousand\\nspectators in a compact, makeshift indoor court in April, it was an act of faith to hope that\\naround 17,000 tickets could be sold just five months later. But Djokovoic’s run to the US\\nOpen final increased the anticipation, and a full house christened Serbia’s natural Davis\\nCup home.\\nThe arena was conceived in the late 1980s as Belgrade applied to host the 1994 world\\nbasketball championships. In 1989 it was awarded the championships, on condition that\\nthe new arena was \\nbuilt. Construction work began in 1992, but with Yugoslavia falling\\napart and economic sanctions imposed on the country, Belgrade was stripped of hosting\\nrights for the basketball in 1993. Yet the project had begun, and on some of the prime\\nbusiness real estate in New Belgrade, an area being developed for business just across\\nthe Sava river from the historical centre of the city. So there was a strong will for it to be\\ncompleted, and when Belgrade was chosen to host the 1999 world table tennis\\nchampionships, work on the arena resumed. But those championships were also\\nwithdrawn after the Nato bombing of Belgrade in the spring of 1999, leaving the arena with\\nan air of being jinxed.\\nIt had by then been built sufficiently to stage some events, and the first one that took\\nplace there was a political rally for the 2000 Serbian presidential election. In an attempt to\\nshow he was the architect of the modern Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic held his final rally of\\nthe election campaign there. He went on to lose the election, and while he tried to cling to\\npower, he was forced to resign after his continuation in office was made impossible by a\\nseries of street protests that culminated in a march of 100,000 people and the setting on\\nfire of the state television building. That appearance in the Beogradska Arena proved to be\\nMilosevic’s final speech in public.\\nWhen the International Basketball Federation awarded Belgrade the 2005 European\\nbasketball championships (‘EuroBasket’), it acted as the incentive to get the arena properly\\nfinished. It opened for basketball in 2004, hosted EuroBasket and the European volleyball\\nchampionships in 2005 but then had to close because it didn’t meet the necessary safety\\nrequirements of a modern indoor venue. So when it was chosen for the Serbia v Australia\\nDavis Cup playoff tie, it had only hosted about half a dozen public events. It has since\\ngone on to become a major tennis venue, with Serbia’s women setting a Fed Cup\\nattendance record when Ivanovic, \\nJankovic and colleagues attracted around 19,000\\nspectators for the visit of Japan in February 2009. Since then, it has also hosted judo and\\nhandball along with other sports and a string of musical events, notably the 2008\\nEurovision Song Contest, after Serbia’s Marija Serifovic won it in 2007 with the song\\n‘Molitva’.\\nThese days the arena is sponsored by a bank, Kombank, so is officially called the\\nKombank Arena. But its position right by the main highway from Belgrade to Novi Sad and\\nBudapest makes it a sight from the ground, as well as from the air, as many routes into\\nBelgrade’s Nikola Tesla Airport fly within easy visual distance of the arena.\\nIn the run-up to the Serbia-Australia tie, Serbia changed its Davis Cup captain. Whether\\nSrdjan Djokovic used his influence behind the scenes to effectively engineer the change is\\nnot certain – he clearly had something to do with it but the impetus seemed to come more\\nfrom the players. Dejan Petrovic had become captain in early 2005 after Nenad Zimonjic\\ndecided that being player and captain was too much for a team just one level below the',\n",
       " 'World Group and very much aspiring to get there. Petrovic remained captain when Srdjan\\nfired him as Djokovic’s coach in the summer of 2005, but with the impending tie against\\nAustralia and Petrovic having played the early part of his career under the Australian flag,\\nthere were questions about whether he was the right man for Serbia. He was also thought\\nof as too laid-back to be the ideal captain – he was liked by the players, but some of them\\nfound him a little too relaxed. So on Tipsarevic’s initiative, Bogdan Obradovic was\\napproached. Obradovic, who had worked with all the Serbian players, took on the job, with\\nNikki Pilic as team supremo (the captain of a Davis Cup team has to be a national of the\\ncountry but the other members of the team don’t, so Pilic was able to help Serbia; he has\\ndual Crotian and German nationality and is the only man ever to have captained two\\nnations – Croatia and Germany – to the Davis Cup title).\\nThe tie itself was never close and Djokovic never needed to play his best tennis.\\nAustralia were effectively a one-man team, relying on Hewitt to win two singles and team\\nup with the veteran Paul Hanley to win the doubles. Although the score after day one was\\n1–1, Janko Tipsarevic had done Serbia’s spadework by keeping Hewitt on court for five\\nsets. Hewitt won the match, but when he and Hanley lost to Djokovic and Zimonjic in four\\nsets on Saturday, the game was up. In fact, Hewitt couldn’t appear for the first reverse\\nsingles and Djokovic had no difficulty blunting the big serve of the Australian left-hander\\nChris Guccione. His 6–3, 7–6, 7–6 win unleashed joyous scenes in the arena. Serbia was\\nin the team-tennis elite for the first time as Serbia (as opposed to Yugoslavia) – it had a\\nyoung team that looked like getting better and it had an arena to act as its fortress.\\n \\nElsewhere in Belgrade, the Djokovic family were starting to make plans for cashing in on\\nNovak’s success. Having spent much of his youth scrabbling for money to fund the\\ninvestment, it was now time to underpin that effort by investing in the future.\\nThe first outward sign of it came in a restaurant, ‘Novak’, which opened one block\\nremoved from the Beogradska Arena. It still exists today, adorned by the statue of Djokovic\\npresented to him at the 2007 Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai – all eight qualifiers were\\ngiven statues looking approximately like them in the style of the ancient Chinese terracotta\\narmy, and Djokovic brought his home to stand outside his first eatery.\\nA second restaurant followed as part of the tennis centre that he opened in the historic\\npart of Belgrade, which formed part of his plans to create a tennis legacy. He had wanted\\nto open a tennis academy but he initially had difficulty getting a piece of land in Belgrade.\\nSo he was offered a piece of land in Kragujevac, a town about 130 kilometres south of\\nBelgrade. The mayor of Kragujevac \\nthought he was on to a winner when he teamed up\\nwith the Djokovic family, but, as the piece of land was a public park used by lots of families\\nand children, the mayor found himself up against the wishes of the people. The people\\nwon, leaving Djokovic back at square one. He then bought a piece of land in Belgrade,\\nwhich he used as a bargaining counter to secure some city-owned land where the\\nUniversity Games had taken place. The city agreed to invest in the complex, so Djokovic\\nnow runs his Novak Academy and restaurant on land he rents from the city of Belgrade.\\nThe site was also the location for the Serbian Open, an ATP tournament that ran from 2009\\nto 2012. The academy concentrates not just on tennis but on the development of the\\nstudents’ character – that may sound a little trite, or from a good PR manual, but given how\\nmuch sport in Serbia found itself in the grip of gangsters and other corrupt and dubious folk\\nduring the 1990s, and Djokovic’s own personal philosophy, the point has some resonance.\\nCynics may look at the academy as a money-making exercise for the Djokovic family,\\nrather than an attempt to invest in Serbia’s tennis future. Both are true: in fact this is what',\n",
       " 'business is meant to be – both sides profit! Serbia’s elder tennis statesman Nenad\\nZimonjic says, ‘We need to use this generation we have of incredible players to invest in\\nthe future,’ and in many ways, that is what Djokovic is doing. And while Serbia’s economy\\nis in better shape than it was in the mid-1990s, it is still a long way from providing large\\nsums of money to invest in non-essential services like tennis facilities. It therefore makes\\nsense for Djokovic to invest money for the benefit of tennis in Serbia, and if it ends up\\nbenefiting him and his family, then everyone ought to be happy.\\n \\nIt’s easy to think of Djokovic as the new golden boy of Serbian sport in the middle of 2007.\\nHe was, but there were two golden girls who were slightly ahead of him that year.\\nJelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic are thought of by many tennis observers as two of a\\nkind. Striking, with outgoing personalities, they reached the top relatively quickly but then\\nslipped back and have lived in Djokovic’s shadow ever since.\\nJankovic is nearly three years older than Ivanovic. She was the world’s top girl in 2001\\n(at the same time as Janko Tipsarevic was the world’s top boy) but had a much slower\\nroute to the top. She was 21 when her run to the US Open semi-finals in 2006 announced\\nher as one to watch. In 2007 she notched up Serbia’s second Grand Slam title (after\\nNenad Zimonjic’s mixed-doubles triumph at the 2004 Australian Open), when she and\\nJamie Murray won the mixed at Wimbledon. By the end of the year she was third in the\\nrankings.\\nIvanovic was very much a contemporary of Djokovic. Just five and a half weeks younger,\\nshe had announced her potential as a 16-year-old, winning a round at the 2004 Zurich\\ntournament and impressing everyone with her poise and confidence, wrapped in a shell of\\ncaptivating politeness and good looks. She burst on to the scene on the clay in May 2007,\\nwinning what was then the leading women’s warm-up event for the French Open in Berlin\\nand going on to reach her first Grand Slam final, when she lost to Justine Henin at Roland\\nGarros. A run to the semi-finals at Wimbledon meant Serbia had a player in the world’s top\\nfive by mid-July, and the end-of-year women’s rankings in 2007 show both Jankovic and\\nIvanovic in the top five, a remarkable triumph for a country still piecing its way out of the\\ntraumas of the 1990s.\\nWith the benefit of hindsight, it’s easy to see both Jankovic and Ivanovic as something of\\na pacemaker for Djokovic. That was never their intention – they were out there for\\nthemselves – but Ivanovic especially played that role. In a glorious weekend for Serbian\\ntennis, Ivanovic reached the final of the 2008 Australian Open and, despite losing to Maria\\nSharapova, climbed to second in the women’s rankings, while Djokovic won the men’s title\\nthe following day and \\nclimbed to third. Ivanovic then went on to beat Jankovic in the semi-\\nfinals of the French Open, in what was a direct eliminator for the new No. 1 ranking, and\\nfollowed that up by beating Dinara Safina in the final to join the Grand Slam and world No.\\n1 rolls of honour in one fell swoop. But Ivanovic sustained an injury to her right thumb in\\nthe days after winning in Paris, lost her momentum and was never the same player again.\\nDespite several years of considerable effort and isolated good results, she has never really\\nlooked like getting back into the world’s top 10, let alone the top three or winning another\\nmajor title. Even if she doesn’t win another tournament, she has still achieved a\\ntremendous amount, but her rapid demise suggests an awful lot of her success was down\\nto belief, that fragile commodity that somehow deserted her after her ascent to the top in\\nJune 2008.\\nFor Jankovic, it was a similar story. Her best year was also 2008, when she reached the\\ntop of the rankings in August, got to her first major final at the US Open and ended the year',\n",
       " 'as the world’s best female player. But she never had a really big shot the way Ivanovic\\ncould crush opponents with her big forehand; Jankovic wore opponents down with her\\nretrieving and counter-punching, and having expended masses of effort to get to the top of\\nthe rankings, she seemed exhausted when she got there. Four weeks into 2009, she lost\\nthe top spot and has never regained it. She has had more success than Ivanovic in recent\\nyears and finished 2013 in the top 10, but she remains one of three women players to have\\nbeen ranked No. 1 without ever winning a Grand Slam singles title, a status she has never\\nseriously looked like losing (the other two are Caroline Wozniacki and the now retired\\nDinara Safina).\\nDjokovic’s subsequent achievements have since dwarfed those of Ivanovic and\\nJankovic, but the two women deserve more than a footnote in his success story. One of the\\nbiggest problems for rising athletes in any discipline is the hope and expectation invested\\nin \\nthem by their fans and countryfolk. For Djokovic to have had two stalking horses who\\nwere capturing a lot of the limelight when he was fighting to break through into the top\\nechelon of men’s tennis was clearly a major benefit for him. And the fact that he gets on\\nwith both of them – especially Ivanovic, thanks to their time spent together as kids – means\\nany competition between them was a friendly and constructive rivalry, rather than a bitter\\nfight for the national attention.\\n \\nWinning the title in Montreal in August had taken Djokovic to third in the world rankings.\\nThat effectively made him leader of the chasing pack behind Federer and Nadal, but such\\nwas the duopoly those two held over the rest of the tennis world that not even reaching the\\nUS Open final could get close to improving Djokovic’s ranking position.\\nAt least Djokovic was guaranteed a place at the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup in\\nShanghai (now the ATP World Tour Finals). He won another tournament en route, beating\\nStanislas Wawrinka in the final in Vienna, and then lost to David Nalbandian in the semi-\\nfinals of the Madrid Masters. But he failed to make any impression in the season-ending\\nfinale, losing all his three group matches to David Ferrer, Richard Gasquet and Rafael\\nNadal. He left Shanghai with his terracotta statue but with a year that had brought him five\\ntitles rather fizzling out. He was glad of the break at the end of his most successful year, a\\nbreak he extended to eight weeks by opting not to play a warm-up tournament for the\\nAustralian Open.\\nThere’s no question Djokovic was a worthy winner of the Australian Open but the old\\nadage that even the best need a bit of luck was well and truly proven. A week before the\\ntournament began, there was real doubt about whether Federer could play – he spent a\\nnight in a Sydney hospital with a stomach complaint that \\ndefied diagnosis but was later\\nconfirmed as mononucleosis. The fact that Federer made it to the starting line-up in\\nMelbourne at all is a considerable achievement, but there was something of El Cid about\\nFederer’s appearance – like the Spanish mythical hero who was paraded in battle despite\\nbeing severely wounded, just to instil fear in the enemy. Federer had reached the semi-\\nfinals or better in his previous 14 Grand Slam tournaments and ended up holding the\\ntrophy in 10 of them. It was certainly worth a try and, by the time the tournament was down\\nto the last four, it looked all set to be another Federer-Nadal final.\\nBut once again it was Janko Tipsarevic – once the leader of the Serbian new generation\\nwho had been totally eclipsed by Djokovic, Ivanovic and Jankovic in the previous 12\\nmonths – who did some of Djokovic’s spadework for him. The previous Saturday,\\nTipsarevic had taken Federer to a 10–8 final set in a 63-game, four-hour, 37-minute third-\\nround match. Federer had come through it thanks largely to 39 aces that saved him having',\n",
       " 'to do too much additional running, but it had taken a lot out of his already depleted body.\\nNot that he would be a pushover for Djokovic, and when Federer served for the first set,\\nfew would have expected an upset. But Djokovic won three games on the run and Federer\\nstarted to make a number of unforced errors. Once Djokovic had saved a set point on his\\nown serve in the third set, he stormed to a 7–5, 6–3, 7–6 victory. One of Djokovic’s post-\\nmatch comments stands out: ‘I’m just very amazed I coped with the pressure today,’ he\\nsaid, revealing perhaps that the way he had lost to Federer in the US Open final four\\nmonths earlier had indeed built up a concern about his match temperament in the minds of\\nothers, and perhaps also his own.\\nThe other massive stroke of luck was that Nadal had been beaten a day earlier in the\\nfirst semi-final by the flamboyant Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. This was effectively the\\nunseeded Frenchman’s coming-out party and he was on fire against Nadal, allowing the\\nSpaniard just seven games in a thumping display. So after three years of Grand Slam\\nsingles finals dominated by Federer and Nadal (it was the first major final since the 2005\\nAustralian Open not to feature one or both of them), the tournament had a final of the young\\npretender against a largely unknown newcomer.\\nSuddenly Djokovic was the favourite. Not only was he the third seed and world No. 3 but\\nhe had the experience of the US Open final four months earlier; for Tsonga, it was totally\\nuncharted waters. Yet when Tsonga hit two stunning forehands to win the first set – one a\\npassing shot winner off a Djokovic smash, the other a lob at full stretch as Djokovic surged\\nto the net – it seemed the tide was with the Frenchman.\\nFor a match not remembered as a great final, it had periods of outstanding tennis and a\\nwonderful atmosphere, characterised by two expressive players and their passionate\\nsupporters. That in itself is interesting. Both at the time and in retrospect, this final is\\nthought of as something of a blip in the glorious rivalry that Federer and Nadal had created.\\nPerhaps the fact that both men were wearing black didn’t help. They weren’t exclusively in\\nblack, both had patterns down the front of their shirts, but from the main television camera\\nangle, it looked like both were wearing the same shirts (they were both with the same\\nclothing supplier at the time) and the world’s colour therapists might mull over whether the\\nfinal would have left a more positive memory if either or both players had worn a warmer\\ncolour. Perhaps also there was, for the first time since Lleyton Hewitt had played David\\nNalbandian in the 2002 Wimbledon final, a major final featuring two players who played\\npretty much the same way with pretty much the same technique, a foretaste of the\\nDjokovic-Murray matches to come that were always fascinating but not always easy on the\\neye. For whatever reason (or reasons), it wasn’t always easy to tell the two players apart\\nduring the rallies while watching on television, and perhaps that explains \\nwhy some of the\\ngreat tennis the two men offered hasn’t helped the final to stand out in tennis’s collective\\nconsciousness.\\nIt was a bit of initiative-seizing that allowed Djokovic to turn the match round. In the\\nseventh game of the second set, a scorching backhand return allowed him to break and, a\\nfew minutes later, he served out the second set. Throughout the third, Tsonga tried to serve\\nand volley more, a tactic that had served him well against Nadal three days earlier, but\\nDjokovic’s returns were well grooved by then and the Serb broke twice to take a two-sets-\\nto-one lead. Djokovic had to have treatment on his thigh after five games of the fourth set,\\nand with Tsonga’s buccaneering style having claimed the hearts of most of the neutrals in\\nthe Rod Laver Arena, a fifth set was a distinct possibility. When Tsonga had a break point\\non the Djokovic serve at 5–5, the atmosphere was electric. But Djokovic guessed right after\\nplaying a short volley, saved the break point with an angled volley and sealed the title on a',\n",

And it was to become his\\nfortress, the tournament at which he has had more success than at any other. Serbia had\\nits first Grand Slam singles champion, and of either gender, given that Monica Seles had\\nplayed under the name Yugoslavia and was ethnically Hungarian and Ana Ivanovic’s\\nFrench Open title was still four months away. As Srdjan, Dijana, Marko and Djordje\\nhugged each other in the players’ enclosure while Djokovic and Tsonga hugged each\\nother at the net, they had the ultimate confirmation that all the sacrifices they had made to\\ngive Novak a chance of getting to the top had been worth it.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER EIGHT\\nMODERN-DAY SERBIA\\nI\\nn 1989 Europe had 27 countries, if you don’t count Iceland, the two Mediterranean island\\nstates of Malta and Cyprus, and the handful of tiny states such as Monaco, Andorra,\\nLiechtenstein, San Marino, etc. On the territory of those 27, there are now 42, thanks to\\nindependence from the old Soviet Union for Ukraine, Georgia, Belarus, Armenia,\\nAzerbaijan, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and the break-up of\\nYugoslavia into six independent republics (Czechoslovakia broke into two but West and\\nEast Germany reunited so, numerically, they cancel each other out). People can be\\nforgiven for having difficulty keeping up with the new countries and it’s often only through\\nsporting events – like European championships and World Cup football qualifying matches\\n– that the new states get the chance to wave their flag across a wide geographic area.\\nSerbia still counts as one of the smaller countries in Europe but one of the larger of the\\n‘new’ states. Its population of just over 7 \\nmillion is comparable to that of Sweden and\\nSwitzerland but the average in the European Union is 18.5 million. And its GDP is barely a\\nseventh of the EU average. Since the privatisation of the largely state-controlled economy\\nover the last 25 years (in reality, over the past 15 years since the wars of the 1990s were\\nsuch a disincentive to investment by outside firms), Serbia has done reasonably well,\\nattracting a lot of investment and a reasonable level of economic growth in the 2000s.\\nHowever, the country slipped back into recession in 2012 and its largely service-based\\neconomy remains fragile. The EU is Serbia’s biggest trading partner but that isn’t all good\\nnews for the Serbs, especially with the euro-zone countries having been in turmoil since\\n2011.\\nSerbia has applied to join the EU and if accession negotiations go well, it is likely to be\\npart of the Union by the end of the decade. But the biggest obstacles to a smooth\\nintegration appear to be less economic and more an adaptation to some of the human\\ncharacter norms that are taken for granted across the bulk of Europe. There are specific\\nissues, like smoking: not that joining the EU would force Serbia to ban smoking in public\\nplaces, but that is generally the norm in western Europe these days, and a day sampling\\nBelgrade’s cafes and restaurants testifies to how far Serbia is from that. On a general and\\nmore important level, do the Serbs have the national mentality to be at home in an\\neconomic community dominated by the Germanic peoples of northern and western Europe\\n(Germans, Britons, Danes, Dutch), with the southern European peoples providing the\\neconomic problem cases? That question has certainly caused its fair share of angst for the\\nGreeks and the Iberians in recent years.\\nIf Serbia is to become integrated into the EU, it will have to put aside residual anger\\ntowards the Croats and ethnic Albanian Kosovans. On a personal level, this won’t be a\\nproblem, as Serbs, Croats, Bosnians and even Kosovans have lived side by side for\\ngenerations and many are good friends today. But the still-simmering tensions between\\nSerbs and Albanians, especially in the Kosovan capital Pristina, are evidence of a conflict\\nin which closure has still not been achieved.\\nAnd when the Serbian and Croatian football teams play each other, it always seems like\\nwar by another set of rules.\\nIn 1999 the two nations played each other in Belgrade for the first time (Serbia still under',\n",
       " 'the name ‘Yugoslavia’ but by then only in conjuction with Montenegro, and the team was\\nlargely Serbian). The match took place in an atmosphere described by all who were there\\nas incredibly hostile. Serbian fans shouted ‘Ustase’ at the Croatian fans – not entirely\\ninaccurately, in the sense that Croatia’s red-and-white \\nSahovnica\\n chessboard motif, which\\nforms a big part of the design of their team kit, was originally the Ustase’s emblem when its\\nmembers set about slaughtering hundreds of thousands of Serbs in the early 1940s. Amid\\nthe already heightened tension, the floodlights went off during the second half, creating\\nnear-panic in the stands and on the pitch. They eventually came back on and the match\\nfinished 0–0, much to the relief of the security forces. The two teams played again in\\nZagreb two months later, with both sides needing to win to keep alive their chances of\\nqualifying for the 2000 European championships. The home fans unfurled a massive\\nbanner saying ‘Vukovar 91’, as a warning to the Serbs that this was an atrocity to be\\navenged, and there was a parade of Croatian war heroes on the field before the match.\\nThe match was characterised by the sending-off of Zoran Mirkovic of Serbia, who grabbed\\nthe testicles of Croatia’s Robert Jarni after Jarni shouted an insult at Mirkovic. In most\\ncountries Mirkovic would have been castigated by his fans for letting the national team\\ndown in a vital qualifier, but Mirkovic was hailed as a hero, especially after giving Serbia’s\\nthree-fingered salute as he left the field. He had been insulted \\nand had sought revenge,\\nand that was fine by his compatriots, regardless of the state of the qualifying campaign.\\nOne could argue that those matches took place in 1999, the year the Kosovo war ended,\\nand things have moved on since. Yet when Serbia and Croatia met twice in World Cup\\nqualifiers in 2013, little had changed. In the first match in Zagreb in March, Serbian fans\\nhad been barred from the Maksimir Stadium to prevent clashes between home and away\\nsupporters. The Serbian national anthem was greeted with cries of ‘Vukovar, Vukovar’,\\nand in an orchestrated piece of chanting, fans in one stand screamed ‘Kill, kill’ while those\\nin another chanted ‘the Serbs’. If that was all unofficial, the Croatian authorities must have\\nsanctioned – or at least turned a blind eye to – the massive banner that read, ‘Through the\\nrough times and through angry fighting, we defended our homes with honour. Those who\\ndefended our land did not die in vain – here in our land, our flag flies.’ Croatia won that one\\n2–0, which probably limited the post-match fallout. Six months later in the return match,\\nboth sides ended a bad-tempered affair with 10 men, Croatia’s Josip Simunic being sent\\noff for a particularly brutal and premeditated foul on Serbia’s Miralem Sulejmani late in the\\ngame. Serbian fans, who had chanted insults at the Croats throughout the match, threw\\nmissiles at Simunic as he left the field. That match, which did involve some away fans,\\nended goalless: another good result for the security forces.\\nIt would be wrong to imply that such intense rivalries don’t happen elsewhere in Europe\\n– they clearly do – but the founding fathers behind what is now the EU were motivated, at\\nleast in part, by creating a culture of economic interdependence, so that rivalries like that\\nbetween the Serbs and Croats would become secondary to both countries’ self-interest.\\nThis is perhaps another area where Djokovic can help by setting an example that the odd\\npainful defeat can still be suffered with dignity, as opposed to a need for revenge.\\nIt’s also important to point out that football has a different status in Serbian culture than\\nother sports, and there is nowhere near the same tension when Serbs compete\\ninternationally in other sports. Only once since the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s have\\nSerbia and Croatia played each other in the Davis Cup: that was in Split in July 2010,\\nwhen Serbia won in the fourth rubber, Djokovic beating his good friend Marin Cilic in\\nstraight sets to give Serbia a 3–1 lead. There was plenty of passionate support for both\\nteams but it never got remotely out of hand. Serbia’s veteran doubles specialist Nenad',\n",
       " 'Zimonjic says, ‘Nole never had a problem playing in Croatia. He played the tournaments in\\nZagreb and Umag, so although the Davis Cup tie against Croatia was a high-risk match,\\nthere was security from both Serbia and Croatia, and we all got along really well. All the\\nathletes were true athletes through fair play and sportsmanship. The crowd was not happy\\nthat we won but they acknowledged us. It’s a different crowd than football. It’s always going\\nto be a rivalry but I think it’s all about respect and sportsmanship.’\\nTennis is often accused of being something of a genteel sport, yet in this case, the\\ngentility of the tennis supporters allowed for a dignified sporting spectacle to emerge from a\\nfiercely contested rivalry. This is perhaps another reason why Djokovic is a different type of\\nnational hero than his equivalents in Serbian football, not just because his character is so\\ndifferent from, say, that of Sinisa Mihajlovic (the former Serbian footballer and now national\\nteam coach) but because Djokovic plies his trade in a sport where losing with good grace\\nis part of the deal.\\nHaving said that, it would be wrong to gloss over the violence that has erupted between\\nSerbian and Croatian fans at the Australian Open in recent years. In 2007, 150 people\\nwere thrown out of Melbourne Park after clashes in the garden area of the grounds,\\nincluding some glass bottles being thrown in an area popular with families and tourists.\\nThe only trigger was that Marin \\nCilic of Croatia was playing Ilija Bozoljac of Serbia that\\nday. And there were further clashes in 2009 and 2010; one on the day Janko Tipsarevic of\\nSerbia played Cilic, the other by the court on which the Serb Viktor Troicki was playing\\nSpain’s Alberto Martin. ‘Serbian’ and ‘Croatian’ participants in the 2007 brawl interviewed\\non Australian television that night all spoke with well-entrenched Australian accents, which\\nrather suggests that the violence had little to do with modern-day Serbia and more to do\\nwith tribal clashes among ex-patriots. But they may reflect the tribal undercurrents that still\\nexist in Serbia.\\nThe subject of racism is one that frequently crops up with Serbia but needs to be tackled\\nsensitively.\\nSerbia was heavily censured by Uefa after its Under-21 football team lost to England in\\nKrusevac in October 2012, a match that featured persistent racist chanting and a mass\\nbrawl involving players and coaching staff at the final whistle. The England player Danny\\nRose was subjected to monkey chants throughout the match and screams of ‘Kill him, kill\\nhim’ whenever he got the ball, and there were several other less directed incidents. Uefa\\nissued punishments to four Serbian players (and two English ones), fined the Serbian\\nfootball association €85,000 and ordered the Serbs to play their next Under-21 match\\nbehind closed doors. Some in western Europe (particularly England) chose to see that as\\na very lenient punishment, which it might be, but some context is called for.\\nThe sports writer Jonathan Wilson, who has made eastern European football his area of\\nspecialisation, says false distinctions are sometimes drawn between anti-black racism and\\nanti-Roma (anti-gipsy) racism. He says that Serbia, as a nation that never had an empire or\\nwas involved in the slave trade, has never had much exposure to black people but has a\\nlong history of discrimination against gipsies, travellers and Romany, both as victims and\\naggressors. ‘Western European nations can’t understand the casual attitude to anti-black\\nracism,’ Wilson says, ‘but they are as guilty of underestimating anti-Roma racism as the\\nSerbs are of turning a blind eye to anti-black sentiments. Neither ought to be acceptable.\\nAll racism, surely, is equally deplorable: the racisms to which western Europeans are more\\nattuned cannot be given precedence and nor can the FSS use what it perceives as lack of\\naction on anti-Roma racism to justify not pursuing anti-black racism.’\\nThis is backed up by the BBC’s correspondent in Belgrade, Guy De Launey. Shortly',\n",
       " 'after the infamous Serbia v England Under-21 international, he concluded, ‘There can be a\\ndifferent attitude towards racism here. After the Krusevac match, I talked to well-travelled,\\nEnglish-speaking journalists who said, “Oh, come on, a few monkey chants towards a\\nblack player isn’t really racism – they’re just trying to put the player off.” I found that\\nastonishing but maybe that’s from a British perspective.’\\nAlthough the role of sport in Serbia is dealt with in a later chapter of this book, it’s\\nanother sporting example – the case of Sinisa Mihajlovic and Patrick Viera – that best\\nillustrates the complexity of the racism issue in Serbia, even if this very public row\\nhappened in a highly charged situation outside Serbian territory.\\nThe rumpus came during a Champions League football match in 2000 when Lazio of\\nRome played the London club Chelsea. Lazio’s team featured Mihajlovic, a volatile and\\ncontroversial Serb nationalist, who these days is coach of the Serbia national team. After\\nthe match, Chelsea’s black French midfielder Patrick Vieira accused Mihajlovic of calling\\nhim ‘a black shit’ during play. Mihajlovic who, like Djokovic, has a Serb father and Croatian\\nmother, has made some highly inflammatory comments and is something of a Serb hero,\\nhaving escaped from his home in Vukovar thanks to assistance from the Serbian gangland\\nhero-cum-warlord Arkan (see page 201) after Croats retook the town in 1995. As such,\\nthere is always the risk that Mihajlovic could be tried by reputation rather than on the\\nevidence, but his defence is interesting.\\nMihajlovic said the insult Vieira had used was ‘zingaro’, a word meaning gipsy but used\\nin Italy as a general term of derision to mean both gipsies and those emanating from\\nsouthern Slav nations. He told Jonathan Wilson,\\nYes, I insulted Vieira, but only as an answer to his insults. He called me a ‘gipsy shit’,\\nso I answered back with ‘black shit’. I am proud of being a gipsy, so I wasn’t offended\\nand I don’t see how he could be offended because I called him black. Vieira provoked\\nme from the first minute, and whatever colour his skin is, I’m not going to let him treat\\nme like that. I am who I am and I would have reacted the same way even on the street.\\nI’ve played football since I was 15 years old and in that time I have been kicked, spat\\nupon and insulted. In football, these things happen. If I am a racist, so is Vieira.\\nInterestingly, Vieira was never charged over the incident, despite ‘zingaro’ or ‘zingara’\\nbeing unquestionably racist, whereas Mihajlovic was banned for two games by Uefa. This\\ncontrast in treatment backs up Wilson’s point about anti-black racism being considered\\nmore of a sin than anti-gipsy racism, at least in the corridors of power of European football.\\nAlthough it in no way excuses his behaviour, it’s hard not to agree with Mihajlovic’s basic\\nlogic that one form of racism is as bad as another. Mihajlovic went on to make a statement\\nfrom the centre circle of the pitch during Lazio’s next home game, saying he had been\\nwrong, expressing regret and saying he didn’t hold racist views. The statement was\\nprompted by an extreme right-wing Italian group welcoming his racist views and he was\\nkeen to dissociate himself from them, but under Italian law he could have gone to \\nprison for\\nthree years, so it may have been a partially tactical disavowal of racism.\\nOther remarks Mihajlovic made about the Vieira incident suggested his biggest beef with\\nVieira was that he brought a matter that should have been left on the field into the public\\ndomain by talking about it in a press conference. It seems to suggest Mihajlovic is working\\nto a medieval, or perhaps gangland, code of ethics, in which honour has to be salvaged\\nand insults avenged. Given the love, affection and esteem his fellow Serbs have for\\nMihajlovic, you wonder whether this undercurrent of tribalism is still working against the\\ninterests of a country that aspires to be a member of Europe’s modern-day economic',\n",
       " 'community.\\nBut there’s a wider point that Jonathan Wilson makes, which needs to be taken into\\naccount. Racism is still a problem in European football, and no doubt it is on the list of\\ntasks for the Serbian football association FSS to deal with. But Wilson says the FSS can\\nbe forgiven for having its attention grabbed by bigger fish.\\nThere was a European championship qualifier in October 2010 between Italy and\\nSerbia in Genoa. It had to be abandoned after a few minutes after a delayed start\\nbecause Serbian hooligans were running riot, but if you look at the context, you see a\\nlot of what’s going on in the background. There was a banner ‘Kosovo is Serbian’ and\\nthe match took place as Hillary Clinton [the then US Secretary of State, or foreign\\nminister] flew to Belgrade to discuss Kosovo. There was also anger that the Serbian\\ngoalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic had joined Partizan, having previously been with Red\\nStar – that was seen as a major betrayal by many Serb nationalists. And there was\\nfury over the arrest of a drug smuggler. Piece it all together and you see that, just to\\nkeep football in Serbia running, the FSS has to tackle hooliganism, organised crime,\\nmatch-fixing, corruption and endemic violence – some of it against a nationalistic\\nbackground that it can’t control. It doesn’t excuse racism, but it does explain why the\\nFSS may have more immediate priorities.\\nIf an element of racism still pertains in today’s Serbian society, what of attitudes to other\\nminorities? Serbian society’s view of homosexuality seems old-fashioned by western-\\nEuropean standards, although as recent debates on same-sex marriage have shown\\n(especially in Great Britain and France), there are many in western Europe who are still\\ntroubled by same-gender sexual relationships. When the Belgrade Pride parade\\nscheduled for September 2013 was cancelled for the third year running, the authorities\\nwere quick to say the decision was taken for security reasons after threats of violence from\\nright-wing and paramilitary groups had emerged from proposed counter-marches. Given\\nthat Serbia is applying for EU membership and thus the protection its legal system gives to\\nminority rights will be closely scrutinised by the European Commission, this was probably\\na wise way to present it. But the fact that there was support for the proposed counter-\\ndemonstration from across Serbia, a country in which the Serb Orthodox Church still plays\\nan influential role, suggests that tolerance of homosexuality is still somewhat embryonic.\\nThe one national characteristic that the Serbs are often accused of – and which many\\nfreely plead guilty to – is a victim complex. Wilson says they ‘revel in the role of the victims\\nof Europe’ and, in his fascinating book \\nBehind the Curtain\\n, he writes, ‘Self-doubt is the\\ndefining characteristic of Serbian football: they are Europe’s most consistent chokers.’ He\\nsuggests the victim complex stems from Serbia’s defeat in Kosovo in 1389, which left the\\nonce independent country under the control of the Ottoman Empire: ‘The defeat remains\\ncentral to the Serbian psyche: they are the wrongly oppressed but glorious losers.’\\nThe BBC’s man in Belgrade, Guy De Launey, pinpoints it to slightly more recent times\\nbut still says the sense of the Serbs as victims is very real.\\nPart of it comes from what happened to the Serbs during the Second World War. In\\nCroatia, the fascist Ustase murdered tens or even hundreds of thousands of Serbs.\\nThat wasn’t forgotten, and when Croat nationalism picked up again in the early 1990s,\\nSerbs living in Croatia were frightened. It was almost as if the conflict resumed in 1991\\nwhere it had left off in 1945. Even when it comes to the Hague war-crimes tribunal,\\nthere’s a perception in Serbia that the Serbs on trial were treated a lot more harshly',\n",
       " 'than others, especially in terms of bail conditions. They saw Croatia and Kosovo\\nspending millions on the defence of their generals and gaining acquittals, leaving the\\nSerbs as the major villains of the piece – but they’ll point out that more Serbs were\\ndisplaced during the conflict than people of any other ethnicity.\\nDe Launey also observes that ‘there’s an image of the Serbs as a lazy people, yet they are\\nall mad on physical activity. There’s even a risk of “boot-camping” youngsters if they show\\nany talent at a sport, and sometimes if they don’t.’\\nThese are largely speculative points of view based on the personal experience of a\\nsample of individuals and hardly the result of deep-rooted socio-anthropological analysis.\\nMost visitors to Serbia will find a largely welcoming if not effusive people, many of them\\noppressed more by the dictates of everyday life than by any national characteristic of\\nvictimhood, racism or national identity. There is one distinctive characteristic that visitors to\\nSerbia will encounter – a strong sense that ‘this is my town and you are the guest’, which\\ncan lead to locals insisting on paying the bill when it \\nmakes much more sense for visitors\\nto do so. It’s a fault that’s easily forgiven because it comes from a sense of wanting to make\\noutsiders welcome.\\nSerbia is in a good position to make the most of integrating itself into the European\\npicture – it speaks the same language as many of its neighbours, so it can build bridges to\\nneighbouring states (not just the ex-Yugoslav republics but also Russia to the north and\\neast) without running up massive translation bills, and it has proved a target for investment\\namong many leading global companies. With its reasonable work ethic, there seems every\\nreason why Serbia, if it plays its cards right, could be much more successful in the\\nEuropean economy than nations such as Greece, Portugal and even Spain and Italy.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER NINE\\nIN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH\\nI\\nn 1961 the Nobel Prize for literature was awarded to Ivo Andric. It was a belated reward\\nfor his book \\nThe Bridge over the Drina\\n, written in 1945 but only translated into English in\\n1959. For a Nobel Prize-winning novel, it is still remarkably little known, though that may\\nwell change when Emir Kusturica’s film adaptation hits the big screen in late 2014\\n(Kusturica is playing a similar role to Djokovic in the arts world – a Serbian film director\\ntelling the world that Serbia is not just a by-word for atrocities, although Kusturica’s manner\\nis much more abrasive than Djokovic’s).\\nThe book tells the violent story of the Bosnian town of Visegrad, just inside the Bosnian-\\nSerbian border, in the 300 years after a bridge was built there over the river Drina in the\\nearly 17th century. It is a work of fiction but based strongly around historical facts. Many\\nhave described it as a fitting introduction to the complexity and character of the history of\\nthe Balkans, and while Visegrad is Bosnian, many of its problems and mix of population go\\nfor the \\nwhole of ex-Yugoslavia. In 1878, in the settlement that saw Serbia and Montenegro\\ngain independence, Bosnia was transferred from the Ottoman Empire into the Austro-\\nHungarian Empire. In this (slightly abridged) extract from the book, Andric describes how\\nthis transfer affected the sleepy town of Visegrad:\\n[As the soldiers began to move away,] officials began to arrive, civil servants with their\\nfamilies and, after them, artisans and craftsmen for all those trades which up till then\\nhad not existed in the town. At first it seemed that they had come by chance, as if\\ndriven by the wind, and as if they were coming for a short stay to live more or less the\\nsame life as had always been lived here, as though the civil authorities were to\\nprolong for a short time the occupation begun by the army. But with every month that\\npassed the number of newcomers increased. However, what most astonished the\\npeople of the town and filled them with wonder and distrust was not so much their\\nnumbers as their immense and incomprehensible plans, their untiring industry and the\\nperseverance with which they proceeded to the realisation of those plans … It seemed\\nthe newcomers were resolved with their impalpable yet ever more noticeable web of\\nlaws, regulation and orders to embrace all forms of life, men, beasts and things, and to\\nchange and alter everything, both the outward appearance of the town and the\\ncustoms and habits of men from the cradle to the grave … Every task that they began\\nseemed useless and even silly. They measured out the waste land, numbered the\\ntrees in the forest, inspected lavatories and drains, looked at the teeth of horses and\\ncows, asked about the illnesses of the people, noted the number and types of fruit-\\ntrees and of different kinds of sheep and poultry.\\nAndric is effectively telling the story, from the residents’ perspective, of how the new\\nAustrian rulers were modernising Visegrad. One could see it as the imposition of Germanic\\norder and discipline on live-and-let-live Balkan culture, and indeed the nice sleepy way of\\nlife that doesn’t need house numbers because ‘everyone knows the priest’s or the\\ncobbler’s house’ is very attractive as an antidote to the anonymity of big-city existence. But\\nmodern industrialised society could only ever have come about with large numbers of',\n",
       " 'people whose lives were logged to some extent by civilian authorities, so what Andric\\ndescribes happening in Visegrad would have happened, eventually, in all parts of the\\nBalkans.\\nWhy is this relevant to the Djokovic story? Because there is a feature of Djokovic that\\nsets him apart from his fellow-Serbs. Talk to any Serbs, or indeed many people from the\\nBalkans, and they will happily admit to a national character trait of victimisation. Then in\\nthe next breath, they might talk about how they were treated unfairly at The Hague when\\nthe war crimes of the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s came to be assessed. It’s as if they need\\nto have someone to blame, or are enjoying their victimhood. In \\nThe Bridge over the Drina\\n,\\nAndric describes a group of women waving goodbye to their sons who had been\\nconscripted, noting about them, ‘It seemed as if they loved their tears and their wailing as\\nmuch as they loved those for whom they wept.’ This is what the English football journalist\\nJonathan Wilson means when he talks in his book \\nBehind the Curtain\\n about the Serbs\\n‘revelling in the role of the victims of Europe’ and their self-image as the ‘wrongly\\noppressed but glorious losers’.\\nIt is probably dangerous to get too much into national characteristics and stereotypes,\\nbut it is clear that there was no room for a victim mentality, wailing or being a glorious loser\\nin the Djokovic psyche. He worked out very early that if he wanted to get to the top in\\ntennis, he had to be disciplined and totally professional \\nabout his approach. Jelena Gencic\\nnoted how he turned up to his first session with her at the age of six with his bag fully\\npacked (including a banana!). Nikki Pilic arranged to hit with him at 2pm, only to find him\\nwarming up 20 minutes early. Mark Woodforde, who worked for three months with Djokovic\\nin 2008 as a consultant, said he was ‘like a sponge in his thirst for information that might\\nhelp him’.\\nAnd the words of Dejan Petrovic are interesting. On seeing Djokovic for the first time at\\nthe age of 14, the Australian-raised Serb says,\\nThe first thing I noticed about him was his professionalism and his dedication towards\\nthe sport. The first time we met at Partizan [the Belgrade sports club where Djokovic\\nsometimes played], I came 15 or 20 minutes earlier and I recall him running around\\nthe court, stretching – that was him; he was a perfectionist in every way. I saw that he\\nwasn’t ‘from Serbia’ – if he’d been a typical Serbian, he’d have come on time, or\\nmaybe even a few minutes late. You could see that he was somewhere else. He\\nalways told me that being at the Pilic tennis academy at a young age and at such a\\ncritical stage of his career did him wonders – having to know what was in his bag,\\nbeing on time, warming up, stretching. But it was probably in him already.\\nAnd yet there is a theme of sickness, or not quite optimum health, that runs through the\\nDjokovic story. It peaked in 2008–9 with the culmination of a series of mid-match\\ntreatments and retirements from matches that exploded in the on-court post-match\\ninterviews at the US Open.\\nIf you discount the match he retired from against Mohamed Mamoun of Egypt in a\\nFutures tournament in 2003, Djokovic has retired mid-match 11 times in tour-level\\nmatches: four in majors, \\ntwo in Davis Cup, two Masters-1000s and three lower-ranking tour\\nevents. The rate has slowed down, for reasons that will be explained shortly: his\\nwithdrawal from the Australian Open quarter-finals in 2009 was his eighth and there have\\nonly been three since (at the time this book to press). But that is still well ahead of other\\nmembers of the world’s top 10. Tomas Berdych and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga have retired four\\ntimes each, Rafael Nadal and Juan-Martin del Potro twice each and Roger Federer once',\n",
       " '(although he did concede two matches on walkovers).\\nThere are no public statistics on the amount of times a player calls for the trainer mid-\\nmatch, but by 2008 Djokovic had made a name for himself as a player who called the\\ntrainer so often it was thought to be largely tactical. Riccardo Piatti, who coached him from\\nJuly 2005 to May 2006, says it was indeed often tactical. ‘He had a problem with his nose,’\\nPiatti recalls. ‘Before we went to America, I warned him it would be very hot and humid,\\nand he might struggle. In Cincinnati it was very hot and then in the first round of the US\\nOpen it was humid and he played five sets against Gael Monfils. I’d told him he might need\\nto call for the trainer to take a break if he found himself having difficulty breathing.’ Early in\\nthe fifth set against Monfils, Djokovic fell down after a rally and called for the trainer. Piatti\\nsays he did it deliberately – on the basis of Piatti’s advice – to buy himself some time. He\\nwas fortunate that the trainer took 12 minutes to arrive on court; by then Djokovic had\\ncooled down and was breathing more freely, so he got his leg massaged and went back on\\ncourt, beating the Frenchman 7-5 in the fifth set.\\nPiatti took Djokovic to see a nose specialist in Milan, one who had treated the Italian\\nfootballer Andrea Pirlo for a nasal problem. He found Djokovic had a double deviated\\nseptum and recommended surgery to remedy it. That surgery took place in November\\n2005 at the start of the off-season and was largely successful, but the injury timeouts\\ncontinued.\\nIn Serbia’s Davis Cup playoff-round tie against Switzerland in September 2006,\\nDjokovic trailed Stanislas Wawrinka by two sets to one on the opening day and called the\\ntrainer after the third set to have his legs massaged. He went on to win the match in five,\\nbut Wawrinka’s team-mate Roger Federer was so angry at what he saw as pure\\ngamesmanship that he launched a stinging attack on Djokovic after he had crushed the\\nSerb 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 to seal Switzerland’s win on the Sunday afternoon. ‘I don’t trust his\\ninjuries,’ he said during his main post-match press conference, drawing a few nervous\\nlaughs from the assembled journalists. ‘No, it’s not funny,’ he added admonishingly, ‘I’m\\nserious. I think he’s a joke when it comes to his injuries. The rules are there to be used but\\nnot abused. But it’s what he’s been doing many times, so I wasn’t happy to see him doing it\\nand then running around like a rabbit again. It was a good handshake for me, I was happy\\nto beat him.’ Federer later had an informal chat with the Swiss press, at which he added, ‘I\\ngot irritated on Friday when he put on this show in his match against Wawrinka. Ninety-five\\nper cent of players use these breaks fairly but this isn’t fair and the rules need to be\\nchanged,’\\nAlthough Djokovic denied he had used gamesmanship against Wawrinka, and he and\\nFederer had a chat in Madrid a few weeks later and made up, he was by now a marked\\nman. Whenever he called for the trainer mid-match, journalists and commentators would\\nmutter – some inwardly, some outwardly – that the injury may be for real or may be tactical.\\nMatters reached a head at the 2008 US Open, when Djokovic twice called for the trainer to\\ndeal with hip, ankle, stomach and breathing problems in his fourth-round match against\\nTommy Robredo. Djokovic won the match in five sets, to set up a quarter-final against the\\nwinner of the match later that day between Andy Roddick and Fernando Gonzalez.\\nWhen Roddick won that match, he was asked by the on-court interviewer whether he felt\\ngood going into his quarter-final, given Djokovic’s various ailments. When the interviewer\\nstarted to list them, beginning with an ankle injury, the witty but abrasive Roddick\\ninterrupted, saying, ‘Isn’t it both of them? And a back, and a hip? And a cramp?’ Later in\\nthe interview Roddick added, ‘Bird flu? Anthrax? Sars? Common cough and cold? If it’s\\nthere, it’s there. There’s just a lot. You know, he’s either quick to call a trainer or he’s the',\n",
       " 'most courageous guy of all time. I think it’s up for you guys to decide. I’ve got to feel good,\\nhe’s got about 16 injuries right now.’ Djokovic beat Roddick in four sets in the quarter-final,\\nthough he was lucky not to have to go to five, as Roddick served for the fourth set and\\ndouble-faulted twice to let the Serb off the hook. So now it was Djokovic’s turn to be\\ninterviewed on-court. ‘That’s not nice to say in front of this crowd that I have 16 injuries and\\nthat I’m faking,’ he said. ‘They’re already against me because they think I’m faking\\neverything.’ Djokovic left the court to boos, this just a year after the Flushing Meadows\\ncrowd had loved him for his on-court impressions, including imitating all Roddick’s nervous\\ntics. As with most storms in teacups, it blew itself out pretty quickly. Roddick said he had\\nmeant his comments in jest, Djokovic apologised for overreacting, and that was that.\\nAnd yet the problem still didn’t go away. At the next major, the 2009 Australian Open, the\\ntwo men again met in the quarter-finals and this time it was Roddick who won, Djokovic\\nretiring in the fourth set citing ‘cramping and soreness in my whole body’. That made it\\neight retirements in less than four years for Djokovic. He may have had the charm to\\napologise and make up behind the scenes, but he was getting a reputation as someone\\nwho didn’t have the stomach for the fight or, more cynically, who preferred to deny his\\nopponent the winning shot by retiring before the end of the match. He was asked in the\\npress conference after that Australian \\nOpen retirement whether he needed to perhaps\\ndevelop a greater trust in his body, so he could play through physical niggles a little more.\\nDjokovic replied,\\nI mean, it’s easy for you to say. If you come into my body, I’ll be more than happy to\\nhear what you think about playing. But I’m a professional tennis player for a couple of\\nyears now. There is absolutely no question about whether I have motivation and will\\nand desire to continue the match and defend my title. There is absolutely no doubt that\\nI have it in me. My mind wanted me to continue. I could have stopped even before in\\nthe end of the second set because I felt really bad. I continued playing, thinking that\\nsomething could help me out, maybe a treatment and things like that. But it just kept\\ncoming back.\\nHistory records that over the next two years, Djokovic turned his fitness and health round,\\nto the point where he won three of the four majors in 2011 and outlasted Nadal in a\\nremarkable five-hour, 53-minute final of the Australian Open in January 2012. It’s therefore\\neasy to assume there was a turning point, a toughening-up of his attitude towards fitness,\\nhealth and lasting out matches somewhere in 2009 or 2010 that proved the key to his\\nascent to the top of the world rankings. But it wasn’t quite like that. If anything, what\\nhappened in 2009–10 was that he finally got on top of a series of health issues that had\\nheld him back to a greater or lesser extent since he had first started playing.\\n \\nIt was Jelena Gencic who first noticed that young Novak always got hay fever in the spring,\\nwhen the flowers were first in bloom. His matches on clay were very difficult. ‘I took him to\\nmany doctors,’ she said, ‘and one said he had a deviated septum in the \\nnose. So his\\nmother and father took him to have an operation to correct the deviation. After that it was\\nmuch better. I also said, “Don’t practise near ambrosia [rag weed],” as those are the flowers\\nthat set him off.’ It appears therefore that Djokovic had two operations on his nose, one\\nprompted by Gencic when he was a young boy, the other prompted by Piatti when he was\\n18. Some of the ailments Gencic claims to have spotted sound like something out of an old\\nwives’ epicurean handbook. ‘When he was feeling very bad in Budapest, when he was\\nplaying a challenger tournament,’ she said, ‘there was a Marza [cat’s flower] by the court',\n",
       " 'and he reacted, so they asked me what to do. I said, “Spray him with salt water from the\\nAdriatic Sea.”’\\nMore seriously, Gencic was worried that Djokovic never ate enough and, right up to her\\ndeath in 2013, she was worried he was still not eating as much as he needed to. She\\nclaimed to have had lunch with him when he was an adult and would say, ‘Nole, Nole,\\ncome on, eat.’ And he would say, ‘Jeca, don’t tell people but I now eat all the Cevapcici.’\\n(Cevapcici is a typical Serbian/Balkan meat dish, probably of Turkish origin.) She also took\\nhim to a homoeopath, who advised him not to eat gluten. It took until he was well into his\\ntwenties before another doctor suggested cutting out gluten, which was one of the turning\\npoints in improving his health. And it took until he was 18 for a coach to realise that his\\neyes weren’t good enough and needed some assistance.\\nIn other words, here was a boy with superb motor skills, a natural talent for tennis and a\\nburning desire to be the best in the world but with a body that, in several important\\nrespects, was not playing ball. Many people who observed Djokovic on his rise to the top\\nsay this led to a cautiousness that was behind many of the trainer and retirement episodes\\nthat so irritated spectators, journalists and other players.\\nNenad Zimonjic, who as Serbia’s Davis Cup player-captain was \\nthe first to call Djokovic\\ninto the Serbian Davis Cup squad, says, ‘Novak always had the No. 1 spot in the world in\\nmind. He was thinking about winning the Grand Slams and the big tournaments, and he\\nalways thought about his health and his body, so he didn’t want to push the limits when he\\nfelt like there was a slight chance of him getting injured. Finding out the problem with the\\nallergies and the gluten, and developing his fitness level to compete at this high level, was\\na slow process, but he improved with everything. When he won the Australian Open for the\\nfirst time he was still very young, he wasn’t really strong physically at the time.’\\nIt’s a view shared by Djokovic’s good friend and former stablemate under Riccardo\\nPiatti, Ivan Ljubicic. ‘He became stronger, physically. And the more you go through it\\nphysically, the stronger you are mentally. I don’t see him as a different person, I see him\\njust treating certain situations differently but it’s still him. He’s overcareful with himself and\\nsometimes people think he’s trying to fake or create something, when he’s just trying to\\ntake good care of himself. Sometimes that’s misinterpreted. I never think he faked injury,\\nit’s just that sometimes he overreacted in certain circumstances – that, I think, is OK.’\\nYet even if such caution is a legitimate explanation for Djokovic’s retirements and calls\\nfor the trainer, they weren’t necessarily doing him any good. In early 2007 he sought the\\nhelp of Mark Woodforde, the former doubles great and Australian Open singles semi-\\nfinalist, largely to help with ‘transitioning’ from the baseline to the net but also to gain from\\nhis experience in big matches. Woodforde was coaching Djokovic when he reached the\\nsemi-finals of Wimbledon in 2007. ‘He was starting to realise he needed to spend more\\ntime on the physical,’ Woodforde says. ‘Everything was in comparison to Rafa and Roger –\\nhe kept asking, “How can they last five sets?”, “How can they back up?” He’d been\\nexperiencing \\nall these great results in the Slams but he was breaking down in the quarters\\nand the semis because, physically, he was not at the same level he’d been at on day one.’\\nHaving played five matches in a rain-affected Wimbledon 2007, which wiped out much\\nof his recovery time late in the tournament, Djokovic developed a blister on his left little toe,\\nwhich became infected. Woodforde explains,\\nHe had retired a few times and that had called him to doubt his own integrity, but when\\nhe reached the semis at Wimbledon, he had this toe problem. I saw the toe and it was\\nhorrific – I hate to think what it was like to walk on. He was even talking about not',\n",
       " 'playing the match against Nadal because he could barely walk and he hadn’t slept. I\\nwanted to implore the whole team that it was important to finish. I told Nole, ‘If you\\nkeep going with this pattern that if you can’t play you stop, you don’t know what state\\nthe other guy is in – he may be going through the same trek as you are and he could\\nfall over at any minute.’ So I said you have to give yourself a chance. The\\naccumulation of matches had certainly made the toe worse, there was a thought\\nprocess going on in his head: ‘I can’t compete, and if I can’t compete to win the match,\\ndon’t play.’ Whereas I said you’ve got to go out and play, at least try – this is the\\nsemifinals of Wimbledon, you can’t not play! I think he had a painkilling injection, so\\nhe did play.\\nMore than that, he won the first set, but once Nadal realised Djokovic couldn’t really move,\\nhe took over, and with the Spaniard leading 4–1 in the third set, Djokovic threw in the\\ntowel.\\nDespite his efforts to get Djokovic to take to the court for that match, Woodforde copped a\\nlot of flak from his fellow Aussies. ‘I had friends coming to me saying, “How can you keep\\nworking with \\nsomeone who retires in the semi-finals of Wimbledon? What are you saying\\nto the guy? How could you let him do that?” Our philosophy in Australia was: when you\\nstep out on the court, you’re fit. You don’t stop. I had to explain that it wasn’t as easy as you\\nthink. I could see this focus – he was asking, “What are Roger and Rafa doing?” because I\\nhave to do a little bit extra. But he wasn’t ready at that time.’\\nAnother two retirements came in early 2008. Having just won the Australian Open, he\\nwas feted in Belgrade, turning out on the balcony of the presidential residence to greet\\nseveral thousand cheering fans. For some reason, on a cold early February day, he\\nappeared in the biting winter air wearing only a T-shirt and light trousers. Whether that\\ncaused the cold that afflicted him when he arrived in Moscow a week later, to spearhead\\nSerbia’s first-ever Davis Cup World Group match against Russia, is not totally clear – the\\nwhole Serbian team was ill that week and a far-from-100 per cent Nenad Zimonjic had to\\nplay singles on the first day having not played singles for years. Djokovic sat out the\\nopening day but partnered Zimonjic to a win in the doubles. Then, needing to beat Nikolay\\nDavydenko to take the tie to an unlikely live fifth rubber, Djokovic played two outstanding\\nsets, only to drop the third. At that point he retired, citing his cold. There had been no\\nindication to his captain, Bogdan Obradovic, or the \\nchef d’équipe\\n Nikki Pilic that he was\\nthinking of quitting – he just stopped. Whether he had internally agreed to play three sets\\nand then stop, nobody knows. But it confirmed his image as someone who might give up if\\nyou could keep him there long enough.\\nAgainst Federer in the Monte Carlo semi-finals, he quit because of ‘breathing problems’\\nafter five games of the second set. It led to another round of critical comments and probably\\nprepared the ground for his spat with Roddick at the US Open five months later.\\n \\nIf there was a moment when Djokovic grasped that there was \\nsomething to be gained by\\nnot quitting, it came at the Australian Open in 2010. A year after his quarter-final abdication\\nagainst Roddick, he played another quarter-final, one he lost in five sets to Jo-Wilfried\\nTsonga. This time he had every reason for retiring because he was suffering severe\\nstomach spasms that came early in the fourth set when he was leading by two sets to one.\\nAt one stage he took an impromptu bathroom break when he wasn’t allowed to. The\\nreferee Wayne McKewen signalled to the umpire that it was OK because McKewen knew\\nthat, if he hadn’t let Djokovic rush to the bathroom, there might have been an embarrassing',\n",
       " 'accident on court. Djokovic threw up in the locker room and returned to finish the match,\\nlosing it 6–1 in the fifth as his strength waned. History records that was the last time he lost\\na match in Melbourne until his defeat to Stanislas Wawrinka in the 2014 quarter-finals.\\nThe man in Djokovic’s corner at that Australian Open was not Marian Vajda but Todd\\nMartin. Martin, a former Australian and US Open runner-up, had been brought in as a\\nconsultant to help Djokovic deal with big matches at the sharp end of Grand Slam\\ntournaments and, with Vajda wanting to spend a bit more time at home, Martin looked after\\nDjokovic on that trip down-under. Of the Tsonga match in January 2010, Martin says,\\nIn my opinion, he had a responsibility. He was still able to play, to compete, but it was\\nmore important than that. In order for him to get to where he is now, he had to cross a\\nfew psychological barriers, and one of them is certainly dealing with the heat of\\nAustralia, the cardiovascular challenges at the extreme. First and foremost, he had to\\nlook in the mirror and say, ‘Do I want to be third for ever or do I want to push this?’ My\\nbelief, though I don’t know this for sure, is that he answered in the affirmative and he\\nstarted doing more work. I think I caught him at an interesting time in his career: one,\\nbecause he was running into some challenges after a very steady and steep rise in\\nthe game, but also at a time when, as a child, he had worked very hard at his craft and\\nthis was his opportunity to cruise a little bit. It was really easy for him to be No. 3, he\\ndefended so well, he didn’t have to learn how to play other elements of the game, but\\nhow much work did he want to put in? How much off-court discipline did he want to put\\nin so he put his best foot forward every time he went out on the court? When he got out\\non the court, he did great. He poured his heart and soul into every match. But that’s the\\neasy part. You have to pour your heart and soul into your practice and into the\\nregimentation of the rest of your day – those are the challenges, those are really big\\nchallenges that the great do very gracefully. I’d be very surprised if he’s not practising\\nmore than he was when I was with him, if he’s not showing better discipline of diet, of\\nsleep, all the things that people watching on TV don’t see. He’s certainly dealing with\\nthe heat of Australia wonderfully now.\\nBut it was not just an attitude shift on Djokovic’s part that came about during that match. On\\nthe island of Cyprus, a somewhat alternative Serbian doctor, Igor Cetojevic, had a lull in\\nhis schedule and turned on the television. It was mid-morning and Cetojevic found live\\ntennis, Djokovic playing Tsonga on the Australian Open night session. Cetojevic was no\\ntennis fan but had been told by Serbian friends to have a look at this Djokovic guy.\\nWatching the match, Cetojevic was struck by how the commentator kept saying of his\\ncountry’s national hero, ‘Novak is struggling with his asthma again.’\\nCetojevic, a doctor trained in allopathic medicine who has moved into more holistic,\\nalternative approaches to health, says he just couldn’t see how Djokovic’s problems could\\nbe asthma. ‘From my \\nobservations and experience with Chinese traditional medicine,’ he\\nsaid, ‘I could see that asthma was not the issue here. I know that generally most asthma\\nsymptoms appear in the morning – and Novak’s match was in the evening. Also, if he\\nreally had an asthmatic condition, he would not have been able to play two good sets\\nbefore the breathing difficulties appeared. I suspected that, in Novak’s case, his breathing\\nproblem resulted from an imbalance in his digestive system, specifically from an\\naccumulation of toxins in his large intestine. In traditional Chinese medicine, the lungs are\\npaired with the large intestine.’\\nThe person who had suggested to Cetojevic that he look at Djokovic had links to the\\nplayer and initiated contact. The result was that Djokovic and Cetojevic met in July 2010,',\n",
       " 'when Serbia travelled to Split for a Davis Cup local derby quarter-final against Croatia.\\nCetojevic did some kinesiological muscle testing and, for confirmation, wired Djokovic up\\nto a ‘biofeedback device’ which is claimed to measure stress, environmental toxins,\\nbrainwaves and food allergies. From those tests, Cetojevic concluded that Djokovic had an\\nintolerance to gluten and, to a lesser extent, to dairy and tomatoes – just what the son of\\npizzeria owners wanted to hear! (Some people, including Djokovic himself, wonder if\\neating large amounts of pizza as a child brought on the intolerances.) It confirmed the\\nfinding of the homoeopath Gencic had taken Djokovic to much earlier, which Cetojevic\\nknew nothing about until contacted for this book. Cetojevic put the player on a diet of\\ngluten-free cereal, fresh berries, nuts and herbal tea. The most immediate result of the new\\ndiet was a loss of weight, and Djokovic didn’t exactly have much weight to lose. But he\\npersisted with the regime and the weight came back. Djokovic also adopted some\\nbreathing techniques Cetojevic taught him, both for stressful situations in matches and to\\nenable him to get a good night’s sleep.\\nIt should be pointed out that, in traditional allopathic medical \\ncircles, such methods are\\nhighly speculative and Cetojevic is a controversial figure. The allopathic world would baulk\\nat such a non-medical diagnosis, as well as his website advertising ‘Energetic Medicine’.\\nBut while the mainstream medical world views Cetojevic’s methods as ‘alternative’, they\\nare very much at the respected end of the alternative-health spectrum. Kinesiological\\nmuscle testing is widely used by kinesiologists, acupuncturists, physiotherapists and other\\npractitioners, and there are plenty of medical professionals who have come to the\\nconclusion that wheat and dairy can be the cause of all sorts of bodily inefficiencies. When\\nasked whether Djokovic found his diagnosis strange, Cetojevic chuckled, saying, ‘I’m a\\nstrange doctor anyway, I take different approaches to most doctors. The problem is that\\npeople are tuned to think that food can’t buy you health – it’s medicine that buys you health\\n– when that’s wrong. Health comes through eating the right food.’\\nCetojevic certainly believes all top-level sports people should eliminate gluten, or at\\nleast not eat any too soon before they do their sport. ‘It’s like putting dirty fuel into a Ferrari,’\\nhe says. ‘You can do it and the car will still run but not very well. Gluten is sticky, it slows\\nyou down. A lot of tennis players still start the day of a big match with croissants and\\ndouble coffee!’ In traditional medical circles, his blanket rejection of gluten is at best\\nspeculative and at worst quack therapy. Yet energy exists in various forms, Chinese\\nmedicine has been around for thousands of years, and with wheat being genetically\\nmodified and mass produced for the world to consume, who’s to say a lot of people aren’t\\ngluten-intolerant who are not picked up by traditional medical methods? The fact that a\\nnumber of people with wheat intolerances can eat spelt, an ancient form of wheat that is\\nnot mass-produced and is genetically different to conventional wheat, suggests that the\\nhuman body may be fine with certain types of wheat, or with high-quality wheat, but\\nlabours with mass-produced, genetically modified wheat.\\nThis is not the place to get into too much speculation about the nutritional and medical\\nproperties of wheat. However, what is beyond doubt is that Djokovic felt a lot stronger as a\\nresult of Cetojevic’s regime. That could be because he was genuinely gluten-intolerant, it\\ncould be purely psychosomatic, it could be a mixture of the diet and better sleep, or it could\\nbe for tennis reasons – for Djokovic to lead Serbia to the Davis Cup title in 2010 freed him\\nup, allowing him to play the sublime tennis that saw him win three of the four majors and\\ntotally dominate tennis in 2011. Any scientist will tell you that, if you tackle a problem with\\ntwo or more approaches, you can never be entirely sure what has solved it.\\nThis is important to remember in the light of a book Djokovic brought out in mid-2013 in',\n",
       " 'which he talks about the discovery of his gluten intolerance. Entitled \\nServe to Win\\n, it’s a\\n160-page paperback that is partly an explanation of the problems gluten causes and partly\\na recipe book, with a few of Djokovic’s life experiences thrown in for illustration. Even\\nallowing for its rather lame title, it’s an unsatisfying book, largely because you wonder who\\nwrote it. Djokovic’s name is on the cover and no ghost-writer is credited, but the ‘voice’ of\\nthe narrative is simply not Djokovic’s – it’s rather breathless, whereas he is a very calm\\nspeaker, and some of the corny references to tennis in passages about nutrition would\\nnever have come from him (wheat and dairy are at one stage listed as ‘the mixed doubles\\nteam from hell’ – ouch!). There is a lot of research quoted but it’s almost all American and\\nDjokovic has never lived in America, and he certainly didn’t have time to do this much\\nresearch in the period when the book was written, because he was playing a punishing\\nschedule of tennis tournaments.\\nThe book has a foreword by Dr William Davis, a medical doctor and the father of Lauren\\nDavis, an American player making her way on the women’s tour who cracked the top 100\\nat the end of 2012. \\nBill Davis has written a best-selling book about weaning yourself off\\nwheat. The voice in the foreword is very similar to the voice in the narrative, which leads\\none to wonder whether Davis wrote the book and put it into the first person for Djokovic to\\napprove, with a few of Djokovic’s childhood and tennis details thrown in to personalise it.\\nYou could hardly blame him – if you’re battling for your theory to be recognised and are up\\nagainst the multi-million-dollar multinational food industry (and especially the multi-million-\\ndollar agribusiness that produces modern wheat in large quantities), you would seize on a\\ntop-level high-profile sportsman who exemplifies your message. If Djokovic was happy to\\nput his name to the book, well, why not? He will, no doubt, have profited financially and felt\\ngood about spreading the word about his good fortune. Or the real author may be Stephen\\nPerrine, who’s listed in the acknowledgements section as the ‘editor and collaborator’ and\\nwho did a number of interviews with Djokovic while the book was being prepared.\\nWhoever really wrote it, the book has some useful information about why gluten \\nmight\\n be\\nbad for you (no two people are alike, so some people may be fine with it) and how you can\\navoid eating it if you need to. It just feels a little dishonest because the guy whose name is\\non the cover clearly didn’t write it.\\nPerhaps another reason why the tone doesn’t feel right is not just its inconsistency with\\nDjokovic but that it makes out that the gluten intolerance was the silver bullet that took him\\nfrom a failure to a world-beater. It wasn’t quite like that. He was world No. 3 even with the\\ngluten, he had been Australian Open champion in 2008 and there may have been other\\nelements that helped him move from Federer and Nadal’s shadow to the undisputed world\\nNo. 1. The fact that he finished the match against Tsonga was also of significance – he\\nlearned not to give up, even if he felt like dead meat for his opponent. His coach Marian\\nVajda has said Djokovic started to hit his forehand harder around this time. And it was\\nsurely no \\ncoincidence that his all-conquering year of 2011 came immediately after Serbia\\nhad won the Davis Cup – as the standard-bearer of a proud nation, that team triumph was\\nalso a key to unlocking his potential (see page 209).\\nThere’s no doubt that identifying the gluten intolerance was a massive boost for Djokovic\\nthe tennis player, and it could well have implications for the restaurant culture in Serbia.\\nThe ‘Novak’ restaurants now offer gluten-free menu options, something of a rarity in Serbia\\nbut probably something that will be copied by other eating establishments. Yet it seems\\nwiser to view the diet as a significant piece in a jigsaw puzzle, rather than the sole key. In a\\npuzzle, certain pieces seem highly significant but the puzzle can’t be completed without all\\nthe pieces.',\n",
       " 'Such was Djokovic’s feel-good factor after working with Cetojevic that the good doctor\\nbegan travelling with him to tournaments. During the year he was part of the entourage,\\nDjokovic won the Davis Cup, the Australian Open, Wimbledon and reached No. 1 in the\\nrankings. At that point, after the Wimbledon triumph, Cetojevic stopped travelling. He says\\nhe was getting sick of the travel – ‘I don’t like hotels and all that rubbish, and all the waiting\\naround’ – and he’d achieved his aim, so it was a natural time to stop working with\\nDjokovic. Vajda was quoted as saying there had been ‘differences of opinion’ with\\nCetojevic but nothing has ever been made of them, and the fact that Djokovic brought out\\nthe book that gives massive prominence to Cetojevic suggests they parted on good terms.\\nCetojevic still speaks incredibly highly of both Djokovic and Vajda.\\nThe culmination in Djokovic’s battle to overcome his array of health impediments came\\nin a 48-hour period at the end of January 2012. After beating Andy Murray in four hours, 50\\nminutes to reach the Australian Open final as Friday night became Saturday morning,\\nDjokovic had to return at 7.30pm on the Sunday to face Nadal in the final. That final ran for\\nfive hours, 53 minutes and \\nDjokovic recovered from 2-4 adrift in the final set. This was the\\nquitter, the man who was always calling the trainer at the slightest sniff. There was always\\nsomething inconsistent between his iron-will determination and his fragility in the big\\nmatches. Finally, the inconsistency was resolved. Roddick’s sarcasm, though\\nunderstandable, had been misplaced – Djokovic was not ‘the most courageous guy of all\\ntime’, he was just cautiously trying to get his health right. Perhaps Roddick can thank his\\nlucky stars that he never faced Djokovic in full health.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER TEN\\nTHE CHAMPION MUST COME FROM WITHIN\\nF\\nrom the vantage point of 28 January 2008, Djokovic looked to have launched himself on\\na career as a Grand Slam champion and permanent front-line favourite for every\\ntournament he entered. Yet with the benefit of hindsight, he was not to leave that particular\\nlaunch pad for another three years. During that period he was the undisputed world No. 3 –\\nalbeit under growing challenge from Andy Murray – but could never break through\\nFederer’s and Nadal’s stranglehold.\\nSoon after that Australian Open, it transpired that Federer had been suffering from\\nmononucleosis or glandular fever. He had even spent a night in a Sydney hospital the\\nweek before the Open and his participation was in grave doubt. The fact that he reached\\nthe semi-finals and came through a gruelling 10–8 fifth-set win against Janko Tipsarevic in\\nthe third round have led some to wonder whether he really did have mononucleosis at all.\\nHe maintains he did, but whether it was that particular virus or something \\nmilder, Djokovic\\nwas clearly helped by playing a below-best Federer. The fact that, in the subsequent 11\\nmajors, Djokovic reached just one final and four semi-finals suggests his 2008 Australian\\nOpen title was a positive blip in a gradual upward trend but that he was still far from the\\nfinished object.\\nHe was after all still only 20; younger than Roger Federer had been when he won his\\nfirst major. Nenad Zimonjic says, ‘When Novak won the Australian Open, he was still very\\nyoung, he wasn’t really strong physically at the time and his serve still had the habit of\\nbreaking down.’ The result was a 2008 that promised more than it was ever likely to deliver\\n– he won another five titles over the 18 months after his Australian Open triumph, plus a\\nbronze medal at the Beijing Olympics that seemed to mean a lot to him. But it was a period\\nof consolidation, rather than a surge forward.\\nOne of those five titles was the inaugural Serbian Open in Belgrade in April 2009. It was\\na triumph for his country and his family, given that his family was behind Serbia’s first tour-\\nlevel tournament. The title forms a nice pair with the Futures title he won at Red Star\\nBelgrade, his first professional tournament victory. But the Serbian Open proved a short-\\nlived triumph, given that the tournament faded badly after that first year and disappeared\\nfrom the calendar three years later.\\nAt the start of 2009 he had switched racket companies, moving from the Wilson frame\\nwith which he had won the Australian Open to a Head frame. Switching rackets is always\\nsomewhat risky, as the racket is the single most personal tool in a tennis professional’s\\nbag and some players opt for a lucrative deal, only to find they lose their confidence on the\\nbig points – for example the Australian Pat Cash won Wimbledon in 1987 and was runner-\\nup at the 1988 Australian Open, both with a Prince racket, but had switched to Yonex by\\nmid-1988 and was never the same again (although some of that was down to injuries).\\nWhile he was no doubt amply rewarded in \\nfinancial terms, Djokovic had played with a\\nHead racket in his junior days, so it wasn’t a completely new frame-maker for him. It took\\nhim several months to be completely comfortable with his new racket, and during those\\nmonths there were plenty who were happy to suggest he had gone for the money over the\\nbest interests of his tennis. For him, that time was an investment in adjusting to a weapon\\nwith which he could conquer the world.',\n",
       " 'And yet by the middle of 2009, he himself and those around him were beginning to\\nwonder where the next surge was going to come from. In May his ranking had slipped to\\nfourth as Andy Murray joined the big three, which meant he was seeded fourth for the\\nFrench Open. He lost to Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round of the French and to\\nTommy Haas in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon. Neither are embarrassing defeats against\\nplayers who, on a given day, can be the equal of the world’s best players, but they were\\nhardly the results of a player on course to break the Federer-Nadal duopoly.\\nSo in July 2009 Djokovic and Vajda brought another voice into their team. ‘This is the\\ngood thing about Novak,’ says Zimonjic, ‘he’s not afraid of trying something different, he\\nwants to improve, he wants to be the best he can be. He could easily have said, “Listen,\\nI’m playing in a time when there are the two best players of all time and I’m happy to be No.\\n3 in the world.” But no, he said he wanted to get better, to beat Roger and Rafa. And he\\nbecame No. 1 in the world with them around. He beat them in the big matches on the\\nbiggest stages; he won the Grand Slams with them there. That shows how good he is.’\\nThe person he brought in was Todd Martin. The tall, studious, softly spoken American\\nwas an interesting choice – he had twice reached the final of a major, losing to Pete\\nSampras in Melbourne in 1994 and to Andre Agassi in New York five years later, but was\\nperhaps better known for blowing a 5–1 advantage in the final set \\nof his Wimbledon semi-\\nfinal against MaliVai Washington in 1996. He was regarded as a likeable man who played\\nsomewhat dour tennis and with a match temperament that could be a little flaky (although\\nthat has to be taken with some relativity, as he won eight tour titles and was a mainstay for\\nthe US Davis Cup team for a decade).\\n‘They felt they needed someone with a stronger playing background, with experience in\\nthe latter stages of Grand Slams,’ says Martin. ‘Someone who played aggressively and\\nsomeone to provide an element of calm into the relatively emotional mix of parents, agent,\\ncoach, physio and player. It came at a time when Marian [Vajda] wanted to spend a little\\nmore time at home. They took me on as a general consultant more than anything else, but I\\nwas at some tournaments when Marian was at home. That made some people ask if I’d\\ntaken over from Marian but I was at home when he looked after Novak.’\\nMartin was instantly struck by Djokovic’s determination and inner confidence. He tells a\\nstory from August 2009, when the two were having a chat with a player who was no longer\\non the tour and who hadn’t had a particularly distinguished career. ‘The conversation was\\nabout the amount of support that federations provide,’ he says, ‘and this one fellow was\\nbemoaning the fact that he hadn’t had the support he felt he needed. When we got on to\\nthe support younger players might get, Novak said, “But the champion must come from\\nwithin,” or words to that effect – he said it very well. I’m a huge believer of that and I used\\nthat line on him a few times because, at that point in his career, I felt he wasn’t allowing\\nhimself to be the champion. He’s obviously crossed that bridge since then.’\\nFor some reason, Martin’s appointment was picked up by the media as being a case of\\nthe American being brought in to help with the Djokovic serve. Martin says that’s ‘a\\ncomplete misrepresentation’, \\nas his role was more general, but the serve did become a\\ncentral feature of his working relationship with Djokovic.\\nHe recalls, of his first meeting with Team Djokovic,\\nI went to Canada to meet them and was alarmed at what I saw with the serve. If you\\nlook at video from 2006–7, he had a beautiful service motion – way better than it is\\nnow. And he serves very well now – I actually think he serves better than he did then\\nbut his serve was a very languid, fluid, beautiful motion. It sounded like he was doing it',\n",
       " 'to protect his shoulder but I have a bit of video that’s shocking – it shows all the\\ndifferent things he was doing wrong, but really, at the core of it, the most important\\nissue needing to be resolved was the fact that his elbow stayed straight until the very\\nlast second of the forward and upward swing, so it was never consistently loaded. One\\nthing Novak does well in every element of his game is get loaded, he’s ready to pull\\nthe trigger, but with his serve he just wasn’t. Because of all the nonsense, if something\\ngoes awry and you try to figure it out with all other stuff, rhythm starts to be a really\\nsignificant issue.\\nAs a new coach, as someone who was working alongside the primary coach, Martin felt he\\nneeded to bide his time before even broaching the subject with Vajda. He encouraged\\nVajda to address it during the off-season at the end of 2009, but for some reason there was\\na conscious decision not to, and in the early months of 2010 Djokovic’s serve was\\nsomething of a basket case. He didn’t serve well at the Australian Open, where he lost in\\nthe quarter-finals to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga – Djokovic puts one horrendous double fault to\\nconcede serve in the fifth set down to the after-effects of throwing up (see page 173) but he\\nwasn’t serving well anyway – and his serving at his next-but-one tournament in Dubai was\\na disaster. Yet \\nhe won the title! ‘The technique was pretty bad,’ says Nenad Zimonjic, ‘but\\nthat showed how tough he was mentally. For me, his biggest win was in winning the Dubai\\ntournament in 2010. It’s extremely fast there, the ball flies, and he was double-faulting all\\nthe time. But he was breaking guys five or six times per match because he couldn’t hold\\nhis own serve, which meant his game was improving a lot except the serve. Once he got\\nback the rhythm on the serve, once he got back better technique, he was even stronger all\\nround. That made him better than ever. Most guys would have given up [and] said, “Oh, my\\nserve is so bad,” and not have fought, but he fought through it and became a better player\\nbecause of it.’\\nIn late February Martin asked Djokovic if he was ready to address the serve issues. ‘It\\nwas an issue for him every day,’ he says, ‘and he said yes. So we spent the next two\\nweeks working on it through Indian Wells and Miami. And then we stopped.’\\nMuch as Djokovic has many admirers for his willingness to take on short-term external\\nhelp, many of those admirers are wary because of the suddenness with which some of the\\nhelp has been dropped. Like others before him, Martin was phoned by Djokovic’s agent\\nand told his services were no longer required. ‘I suspect his dad encouraged the end of the\\nrelationship,’ he says, ‘but I didn’t have much to do with him. I had dinner with Srdjan once\\nor twice and we were together in London for the ATP Finals, and maybe one other time,\\nbut largely I had little or no contact with him, mainly because of the language barrier. I do\\nthink that Srdjan was part of it all but in a different way. I think that there was a transition\\noccurring, an establishment of some autonomy in Novak’s own life. I think his existence\\nwas dysfunctional at the time and I think I was collateral damage.’\\nThat’s a fair enough assessment from Martin’s perspective, but from Team Djokovic’s\\nperspective, Martin simply didn’t fit. When news emerged in April 2010 that Martin had left\\nthe entourage, \\nDjokovic’s main comment to the media was that ‘it just didn’t work out’. In\\nan interview with ESPN just over a year later, Vajda said, ‘There was bad communication;\\nit was really counterproductive. He went down with the serve; he couldn’t serve last year. It\\nwas terrible. Everything was tough. Novak never had the impression to [avoid] work but the\\ncommunication was different. Todd was a big player and also wanted to try something\\nnew. But Novak was all set up, he only [needed] small improvements.’ And in a later\\ninterview with the \\nDaily Telegraph\\n, Vajda said, ‘When Todd came it was counter-',\n",
       " 'productive. Somehow Todd didn’t recognise Novak as a holistic person.’\\nDespite being fired, Martin remains on very relaxed terms with Djokovic and there\\nappears no bitterness on either side about the way it ended. He says,\\nI think I helped with the diagnosis [of the serve problem] but wasn’t given an\\nopportunity to see through the cure. I had a pretty clear vision for what I felt he needed\\nto be doing and now he starts with a bent elbow and he keeps it bent throughout his\\nmotion. But while the end of our working relationship was bizarre at the time, I walked\\naway feeling like every coach’s primary objective should be to become unnecessary. I\\ndidn’t become unnecessary during my time with Novak, but I’m sure I’ve planted a few\\nseeds that have contributed to my being unnecessary. I don’t think anyone from the\\noutside looking in would have come in and said much different to what I said. They’d\\nhave said, ‘Eventually, you’ll have to play with some force.’ The first time I hit with\\nNovak I was blown away by how heavy his ball was and then I’d watch him compete\\nand he’d hit the ball 10 per cent slower than whoever he was playing. These days he\\ngoes out and lets the guys have it. That’s effectively made him significantly more\\noffensive than anything to do with volleying better. You don’t have to volley better to\\nbe able to come to the net with more authority.\\nLooking at the three years between Djokovic winning the Australian Open and his \\nannus\\nmirabilis\\n of 2011, it’s tempting to look for a turning point. The match with Tsonga in January\\n2010 is an obvious one, as is Serbia’s Davis Cup triumph in December 2010. But Djokovic\\nhimself says that, if there was a distinct point after which things really moved forward for\\nhim, it was the French Open and Wimbledon in 2010. ‘There were a few particular\\nmoments that I would say were turning points,’ he said in 2013, ‘but probably Wimbledon\\n2010. Since that tournament, I started playing much better, more confident. The first six\\nmonths of 2010 I was going through a lot of health issues, I wasn’t able to [get] so many\\ngreat results, I lost a lot of confidence but managed to come back.’\\nIt’s a point made by Nenad Zimonjic. ‘After he made the semis at Wimbledon, that was\\nthe point when he got the confidence back. Then he started to play better. We noticed it at\\nthe Davis Cup quarter-final against Croatia a week later. He was under a lot of pressure,\\nhis serve still wasn’t working well but he came through it. It was like a final couple of\\nstruggles that made him where he is now – everything from struggling for funding in his\\nteenage years to his serve breaking down, it all made him stronger.’\\nThe shock to the system that galvanised him into an extra level of determination came\\nwhen he lost to Juergen Melzer in the French Open quarter-finals. He led the 29-year-old\\nAustrian by two sets to love, then had a break midway through the final set before losing it\\n6–4 in four and a quarter hours. Again there were signs of breathlessness, described on\\nthe day as ‘hayfever-like symptoms’, and there was one controversial line-call in the final\\ngame that went against Djokovic after the umpire inspected a mark in the clay. But the\\nsense was that he was a round ahead of himself, preparing to face Rafael Nadal in the\\nsemis before dealing with the obstinate Melzer.\\nDjokovic should, perhaps, have reached the Wimbledon final four weeks later. After\\ncoming back from two-sets-to-one down to beat the diminutive Olivier Rochus in the first\\nround, he had dropped just one set en route to the semi-finals, that against the former\\nchampion Lleyton Hewitt, who was still a top-30 player. He then faced Tomas Berdych, the\\nman who had put out the defending champion Roger Federer in the previous round.\\nDjokovic thought his steadier groundstrokes would win the match for him but he was too\\nconservative and the big-hitting Czech took advantage. Still Djokovic may well have won if',\n",
       " 'he’d converted one of the two set points he had in the second set tie-break – he had come\\nback from 2–6 down, saving four set points five times (at 5–6, they replayed a point\\nDjokovic had clearly won with a lob). Once he lost the tie-break 11–9, the game was up\\nand Berdych won in straight sets.\\nHad he won that match, it’s hard to see Djokovic having beaten Rafael Nadal in the final.\\nThe Spaniard was in his raging best form and doused the power of Berdych’s powerful\\ngroundstrokes in an emphatic display to claim his second Wimbledon title. But Djokovic\\nhad done enough to make himself feel good about where his game was going.\\nHis victories over Croatia – over the weekend he was introduced to Igor Cetojevic for the\\nfirst time (see pages 174–5) – were less important in tennis terms than in socio-political\\nterms. This was a local derby, and while the two sets of supporters were very different in\\ncharacter from football fans attending a Croatia-Serbia international or a Dinamo Zagreb v\\nRed Star Belgrade club match, it was still a highly charged atmosphere in Split’s\\nSpaladium. His straight-sets wins were over two friends: Ivan Ljubicic, by then well \\npast his\\nbest and only turning out because of an injury crisis in the Croatian team, and the world\\nNo. 13 Marin Cilic. Cilic’s win over Janko Tipsarevic meant his match with Djokovic was\\nlive on the final day, but Djokovic played an outstanding match, dropping just eight games.\\nThe real premium from his Wimbledon confidence boost came at the US Open, when he\\nreached the final by beating Roger Federer in the semis, saving two match points in the\\nprocess. This time Federer was the conservative one while Djokovic went for his shots on\\nthe big points – including one breathtaking forehand to end a long rally and save a match\\npoint – and was rewarded with a 7–5 win in the fifth set. He was beaten in the final by the\\nall-conquering Nadal, the Spaniard being deprived of a calendar-year Grand Slam only by\\nthe knee injury he suffered in the first set of his Australian Open quarter-final – without that,\\nNadal would probably have won all four majors that year. But the big story for Djokovic for\\nthe rest of 2010 involved Serbia’s quest to win tennis’s premier team prize, the Davis Cup.\\nAnd that US Open final, which took place on the Monday evening because of rain, very\\nnearly thwarted the Serbs.\\nDjokovic arrived back in Belgrade feeling worse for wear. The secret was kept from\\nSerbia’s Davis Cup semi-final opponents, the Czech Republic. Indeed, Djokovic was\\nnominated on the Thursday to play in Friday’s singles. But on Friday morning, using a rule\\nthat has to exist for pragmatic reasons but undermines other Davis Cup rules, Serbia\\nreplaced Djokovic for medical reasons, saying the player had gastroenteritis. His place\\nwas taken by Viktor Troicki, who promptly lost to Radek Stepanek. Serbia’s cause was\\nsaved by Janko Tipsarevic’s superb win over a tiring Tomas Berdych, whose stellar year\\nwas beginning to catch up with him.\\nMirroring what Serbia had done two years earlier when Djokovic was ill for the tie\\nagainst Russia, Serbia’s captain Bogdan Obradovic opted to throw Djokovic in for the\\ndoubles alongside \\nhis old mentor Nenad Zimonjic (officially it was the captain’s decision,\\nbut most people assume Djokovic calls the shots in the Serbian team and Obradovic has\\nthe diplomatic skills to present decisions as his own – this happens in a lot of Davis Cup\\nteams with one dominant player). Djokovic and Zimonjic had won their two previous Davis\\nCup doubles but this time they were up against quality opposition in Berdych and\\nStepanek, and the Czechs won in four sets, ending the match with an emphatic 6–1 in the\\nfourth. On that Saturday night, the Serbian dream of a first Davis Cup success, which had\\nlooked so favourable given their home draws, looked to be evaporating.\\nAt least Djokovic had had some court time, which was supposed to help him against\\nBerdych in the first reverse singles. Yet with the Czech leading by a set, and a break up in',\n",
       " 'the second, it was all going wrong for the Serbs. That was when Djokovic summoned up\\nhis acting skills. By then (September 2010) he had effectively given up on his\\nimpersonations of other players’ strokes, but his ability to act was needed to outpsyche\\nBerdych and turn the tide of a match Serbia had to win.\\nIn the sixth game of the second set, Djokovic was playing some desperate defence. He\\nthrew up a lob, Berdych smashed it into the ground and, as the ball bounced up high, the\\nSerb lunged to try and retrieve it. It was a hopeless cause, and as he came down, he fell\\nand ended up motionless on the surface behind the baseline. As the applause died down,\\nDjokovic continued to lie motionless. A nervous hush descended over the Beogradska\\nArena. The umpire got off his chair and ran over to the player to see if he was all right.\\nObradovic left his bench to see if his man was all right. Only with a crowd of people around\\nhim did Djokovic start to move. He was eventually helped back to his chair on the\\nshoulders of Obradovic and the Serbian team physio.\\nFor a few moments, the 17,000-strong crowd thought their \\ndreams were over. Their hero\\nwas wounded, already struggling against a fired-up Berdych and now unable to fight back\\nwith full fitness. But Djokovic wasn’t really injured. Although he wasn’t going to admit this\\nfor fear of bringing the game into disrepute, he knew Berdych was vulnerable to having his\\nrhythm disrupted, so he had to find a way to disrupt it. The Czech is one of the best ball-\\nstrikers of his era, and when he’s on song he can beat the very best, but there is a slightly\\nformulaic nature to his play, and Djokovic had figured he just needed to knock the Czech\\noff his stride. So a thin, almost pathetic bandage was put under Djokovic’s left knee, he\\ncame back out to continue the match, promptly broke back, broke again to level the match\\nat one-set-all and duly won in four sets. Was it gamesmanship? – probably, but his country\\ncame calling, and he did what he needed to. And it was all within the rules, albeit rules\\nwritten to keep tennis going when a player is injured. The more interesting interview after\\nthe match came from Berdych, who clearly felt Djokovic had exploited the rules but refused\\nto make a big thing of it, no doubt because he felt a bit sheepish at having fallen into the\\ntrap.\\nWith Janko Tipsarevic playing one of his best-ever Davis Cup matches to beat Stepanek\\nin the fifth, Serbia’s Davis Cup dream moved on in dramatic style. The nation was in the\\nfinal, and that final would be at home against one of the giants of Davis Cup history,\\nFrance.\\nThe final was clearly Djokovic’s priority at the end of the year. He played five tour events,\\nwinning Beijing and losing in the final of Basel to Roger Federer. He reached the semi-\\nfinals of the ATP Finals in London but was almost a little lacklustre in going down 6–1, 6–4\\nto Federer – everyone recognised that his mind was not on winning a second year-ending\\nsingles title but on the national challenge a fortnight later. Yet that defeat to Federer on 19\\nNovember 2010 should not go unnoticed. Although no one knew \\nit at the time, it was to be\\nDjokovic’s last defeat for six and a half months – or 195 days.\\nThe Davis Cup final followed a similar pattern to the semi-final – in fact, a similar pattern\\nto many of Serbia’s matches. There is an implicit assumption when Djokovic plays that his\\ntwo singles are largely counted as bankers, with the Serbs needing one win from the three\\nother matches. With a team of three top-50 singles players and an experienced doubles\\nspecialist, that gave the Serbs three realistic bites of the cherry, yet when Tipsarevic\\noffered very little resistance against France’s top player Gael Monfils on the opening day,\\nand with Troicki and Zimonjic squandering a two-set lead to lose the doubles to Arnaud\\nClement and Michael Llodra, Serbia’s dream rested on the hosts winning both the final\\nday’s singles.',\n",
       " 'Djokovic was majestic in beating Monfils for the loss of just eight games. He was feted\\nas a conquering hero as he walked into the Belgrade Arena in his red Serbian shirt, and he\\ncrushed Monfils like a man on a mission. But the loss of the doubles meant that win only\\nteed up a decisive fifth rubber – Djokovic couldn’t hit the cup-winning shot himself.\\nWhether it was his decision or Obradovic’s, the responsibility of winning the Davis Cup\\nwas given to Victor Troicki and not Janko Tipsarevic, largely because Troicki emerged\\nfrom his doubles with more confidence than Tipsarevic had emerged from his singles on\\nthe Friday. It proved an inspired decision, although the luckless Michael Llodra freezing on\\nthe other side of the net also assisted Serbia’s cause. Troicki, an only child who viewed his\\nDavis Cup team-mates as his brothers, played the match of his life and saw Serbia to the\\nmost ecstatic of victories.\\nIt was Troicki who, during the quarter-final against Croatia five months earlier, had\\nsuggested that if Serbia won the Davis Cup, the players and team officials would all have\\ntheir heads shaved. Such private bets or challenges often happen, but few expected this\\none to happen so publicly. A hairdresser had been hired for the day, and \\nonce Troicki had\\ndone his post-match on-court interviews, all four players, plus the captain Bogdan\\nObradovic, the Serbian Tennis Federation president Slobodan Zivojinovic and even the\\nseptuagenarian team supremo Nikki Pilic, all came under the electric razor. It was a\\nnightmare for the International Tennis Federation staff, who were trying to prepare the\\npresentation ceremony of the biggest jewel in the ITF’s crown – respected marketing and\\norganisational executives, power-dressed to give the impression of professional slickness,\\nfound themselves with brooms, sweeping away shaved tufts of hair from the presentation\\nstage. What the players will think when they show their grandchildren the photos of the\\nteam holding the trophy is open to question – they’ll probably just have to explain that they\\nwere so happy they weren’t responsible for their appearance. Asked about his new look an\\nhour later, Djokovic said in an interview, ‘I’m wearing a hat – that tells you all you need to\\nknow.’ Despite never having let his thick hair grow anywhere near what could be\\ndescribed as long, or even medium length, Djokovic was delighted that he had a few\\nweeks for it to grow back before his next public appearance in January in Australia.\\nThere was something touching about the chaos with which Serbia’s Davis Cup triumph\\nwas celebrated. There is always an official dinner a couple of hours after the final finishes,\\nin which it is customary for the losing team to turn up smartly dressed in a show of\\nsportsmanship. Such dinners are carefully organised and choreographed, but on this\\noccasion more people turned up than had invitations, and even some of the Davis Cup’s\\nstalwart officials found their promised seat had been occupied because it was just the\\nplace to be for everyone who thought they were anyone in Belgrade society.\\nLater, in the small hours, there was a party in a club just off Republic Square in the\\ncentre of Belgrade. A Serbian brass band played traditional Serbian music as the players\\ncelebrated their success. None of the four would want that night to be seen as \\ntypical of\\ntheir approach to the discipline required of top-level athletes – as well as having several\\nglasses of champagne, they all smoked Cuban cigars, a sign of the opulence they must\\nhave felt (although smoking is much more a part of national culture in Serbia than in\\nwestern Europe or America). The Serbian sports journalist Zoran Milosavljevic, who was\\npresent, said, ‘The raw emotions Djokovic and the other players let out at that party\\nshowed just how deep the patriotism runs in him. You could see why he would do it, why\\nsome people say he would prop up Serbia with one hand if necessary.’\\nThe players were heroes. They had put Serbia on the map and all four were given\\ndiplomatic passports in April 2011. On the night of Sunday 5 December 2010, it seemed',\n",
       " 'that this was the height of their careers – what could possibly compare with this? Maybe\\nwhen they all finish playing some will quote that night as the pinnacle, but for all of them,\\nthe Serbs’ Davis Cup success was to prove the springboard to dramatic rises in personal\\nfortunes over the next couple of years, none more so than for Djokovic himself.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER ELEVEN\\nTHE ROLE OF SPORT IN SERBIA\\nT\\no say sport is an integral part of Serbian life and culture would be accurate, but it doesn’t\\ntake us very far. For a start, one needs to distinguish football from the rest of sport – football\\nis so engrained that it has for decades been an extension of wider battles, whether inter-\\nnation struggles and self-determination, or nationalist versus federalist systems of\\ngovernment. And the other sports that feature prominently in Serbian life are generally\\nteam sports, so while Novak Djokovic may come from a country with sport in its blood, you\\nwon’t find many tennis balls in the arteries.\\nHaving said that, when comparing Djokovic’s standing in Serbia with, say, Roger\\nFederer’s in Switzerland, the sporting backdrop is much more in Djokovic’s favour. The\\nSwiss are a landlocked people with no raw materials – their affluence has been achieved\\nthrough hard work in a variety of labour-intensive industries: watch and clock making,\\ncheese, chocolate and tourism. As such, the Swiss are happy to admire the exploits of a\\ntop-level sportsman but respect \\nfor entertainers and athletes doesn’t run to celebrity\\ncomplexes. Federer has often remarked how he can still walk through the streets of his\\nhome city of Basel without too many people stopping him, and a childhood tennis-playing\\nfriend of his who went on to become an adviser in Swiss politics said, ‘You couldn’t\\nimagine the Swiss having a David Beckham culture.’ By contrast, sport stands on a\\nsufficiently high pedestal in Serbian life that Djokovic can become a national hero, even if\\nfew fully understand his sport.\\nFootball is clearly streets ahead as Serbia’s top sport. Then basketball comes a clear\\nsecond. Next would come volleyball and handball, and water polo is also very popular. So\\nthe top five sports in Serbia are all team sports, with tennis not really scoring. Until the\\nIvanovic/Djokovic golden age, tennis was thought of very much as a minority elite sport,\\nplayed by the old royal family and their cohorts but not really by the people. But then all\\nindividual sports struggle for recognition in Serbia – a few boxers, wrestlers and shooters\\nhave become short-term heroes and Serbia won gold in taekwondo at the London\\nOlympics. But it’s mainly a team-sport nation, which explains the importance to Djokovic\\nand Serbia of winning the Davis Cup in 2010. In the eyes of his compatriots, that was the\\nultimate achievement in his sport, especially as he was able to do it on home soil.\\n \\nThe magnitude of football’s role in Serbian consciousness is probably best understood by\\nthe part it played in the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, in particular the Serbo-Croat war. A\\nfull description of just how closely football and Serbian nationalism were linked in the\\n1990s appears in Jonathan Wilson’s book \\nBehind the Curtain\\n, and these pages can only\\noffer a brief summary.\\nA number of people are willing to say – quite seriously – that the opening salvo in the\\nSerbo-Croat war was fired when Dinamo Zagreb played Red Star Belgrade in 1990.\\nIndeed, there is a statue \\noutside Zagreb’s Maksimir Stadium that depicts a group of\\nsoldiers and underneath is the dedication, ‘To the fans of this club, who started the war\\nwith Serbia at this ground on 13 May 1990.’ The match came shortly after the election of\\nFranjo Tudjman as president of Croatia on a nationalist platform, and Dinamo Zagreb’s\\nmost loyal fans had pledged allegiance to Tudjman’s HDZ party. Rocks had been',\n",
       " 'stockpiled in advance; Red Star fans had brought bogus Belgrade number plates with\\nthem, which they put on Zagreb cars to con Dinamo fans into pelting rocks at their own\\nnationals. Hundreds were arrested and well over 100 injured, including 79 police officers.\\nBut if Dinamo v Red Star was a massive grudge match within the old Yugoslavia, the\\nBelgrade city derby between Crvena Zvezda (Red Star) and Partizan is even more\\nintense. Known as ‘the eternal derby’, the two teams were forever associated with rival\\npolitical ideologies. Red Star was thought of as the Serbian nationalist club, while Partizan\\nwas the club of Tito’s Partisans, the multi-nation force that repelled the Croatian Ustase\\nand the Serbian Cetniks to help unify Yugoslavia after 1945. Indeed, in the late 1950s,\\nFranjo Tudjman, a fervent Croatian nationalist, was president of Partizan and is believed to\\nbe responsible for the club’s now familiar black-and-white playing strip. Partizan still exists,\\nbut the break-up of Yugoslavia means the political element has been severely weakened,\\neven if the rivalry with Red Star is as strong as ever.\\nThe political lines were never quite as firm as they were talked up to be. Red Star was\\nfounded in 1945, presumably by communists, as the red star is a communist emblem – it\\nwould certainly have been a smart move, given the way the political wind was blowing at\\nthe time. As the club has always been associated with the poor and oppressed, it’s easy to\\nsee how it could have been founded by the communists but at the same time be anti-\\ncommunist, given that Tito’s post-1945 regime was a communist \\none (albeit without the\\nsame degree of economic collectivism prevalent in the Soviet bloc). In the 1970s, rival\\nclubs taunted the Red Star fans with the term ‘gipsies’, an insult the Red Star faithful\\nhappily took on. It meant that, whenever Red Star’s fans came across fans from another\\nclub, violence was almost inevitable, though in fairness, the same could be said for many\\nleading clubs in English football in the late 1970s (the English happily forget that punch-\\nups were very much part of what many football fans were looking for at that time, despite\\nthe mealy-mouthed attempts by football administrators to claim it was ‘only a small\\nminority’). And if that other club was Partizan, the antipathy was at its most fierce. Support\\nfor the Yugoslav national team was always somewhat fragmented, as citizens of one\\nconstituent republic never quite knew how much to cheer for players from another nation,\\nand that even extended to intra-city rivalry. Some Partizan players representing Yugoslavia\\nwere booed by their own crowd if there was a strong Red Star element in the stands.\\nThe two sets of supporters of Red Star and Partizan amply illustrate the integration of\\nsport, or at least football, into Serbian society.\\nPartizan’s supporters are known as the ‘Grobari’, which means gravediggers or\\nundertakers. Formed after Partizan reached the 1966 European Cup final, their home is in\\nthe South Stand of the club’s home ground, the Partizan Stadium (formerly the JNA\\nStadium; JNA was the Yugoslav National Army), and the name comes from the cemetery\\nof a church just by the stadium. They had a fearsome reputation in the 1970s and 1980s,\\nand hooliganism accompanied them across Europe. Officially, the Grobari were shut down\\nas an official entity in the 1990s after a rocket fired from the South Stand killed an eight-\\nyear-old Red Star fan during an eternal derby, but the name lives on in local parlance and\\noccasional banners.\\nRed Star’s supporters are known as the ‘Delije’, a word that loosely translates as ‘hard\\nmen’ or ‘strong ones’. The Delije are broken down into several sub-groups, some with\\nbelligerent names such as Red Devils, Zulu Warriors and Ultras, and they come together\\nat their spiritual home in the North Stand of the Red Star Stadium in central Belgrade (also\\nknown as the Marakana – see below). But this is more than just a fan club. The Delije have\\nbecome known as something of a self-help society for Red Star fans. If that sounds all very',\n",
       " 'nice, it’s got a real edge to it, almost like something out of gangland culture. Many people\\nin difficulties are helped but in a rather sinister, Masonic way. And when the battle for\\nSerbian independence from Yugoslavia got underway, it’s hardly surprising that the links\\nbetween the Delije and the unofficial militias supporting the Serbian military should be so\\npronounced.\\nThe biggest link came in the form of a mythical figure known as Arkan. His life story is\\npure gangster film script, and if no one has made a film about him, a chance has been\\nmissed, certainly in Serbia where – despite or because of his brutality – he is something of\\na folk hero.\\nBorn Zeljko Raznatovic in 1952, Arkan was forever in trouble with the law, and\\nimprisoned several times, including in Belgium, the Netherlands and West Germany. But\\nhe always seemed able to escape from jail, perhaps because of contacts he made with the\\nYugoslav state security service in his teens. He returned to Yugoslavia in 1983 and was\\none of the fans arrested at the notorious Dinamo Zagreb v Red Star Belgrade match in May\\n1990. In fact, Arkan was credited with cementing the name ‘Delije’ in an official\\ninauguration in January 1989. At this time he was assembling a paramilitary force to play a\\nkey part in the forthcoming civil wars, and his force, known as the Tigers, was recruited\\nlargely from the Delije. The Tigers were involved in some of the most horrific battles of the\\nYugoslav wars, notably Vukovar \\n(Croatia) in 1991 and Bikjeljina (Bosnia) in 1992, often\\nsinging the songs they sang on the terraces at football matches. Arkan himself was\\nindicted for war crimes during those battles but died before he could be brought to trial.\\nSome of those songs of the Delije and the Tigers were sung on the terraces of the\\nflower-shaped San Nicola stadium in Bari, when Yugoslavia celebrated arguably its\\ngreatest sporting moment. That was when Red Star Belgrade won the European Cup (the\\nforerunner of today’s Champions League). The history of Yugoslav football was a tale of\\nthe nearly men. Three times they had reached the Olympic football final but come away\\nwith silver. Twice they had been World Cup semi-finalists but failed to reach the final.\\nPartizan lost the 1966 European Cup final and Red Star lost the 1979 UEFA Cup final. No\\nwonder many were happy to tag Yugoslavia ‘chokers’.\\nBut in 1991 Yugoslavia had a champion football team, albeit just at the moment when\\nthe country was unravelling in a sea of blood. The final in Bari was a horribly dour match,\\nin which Red Star and Olympique Marseille – the French club that was about to be\\nembroiled in a massive scandal surrounding its controversial owner, the French\\nentrepreneur Bernard Tapie – played out a goalless draw over 120 minutes of normal and\\nextra time. Red Star then won on penalties. Or perhaps it would be better to say Marseille\\nlost on penalties, as the French club had a team full of players who had blown vital\\npenalties in past shoot-outs and were haunted once more. Europe’s most prestigious club-\\nfootball title – if not the world’s – was therefore a fillip for the club and, to a lesser extent, for\\nthe city of Belgrade, but not for Yugoslavia. Within a few months, the nations of some of the\\nRed Star players were at war with each other, and within a year the club was banned from\\nplaying home games on Serbian soil.\\nIn the mid-1990s Arkan tried to take over Red Star but failed. So \\nin 1996 he bought a\\ntraditional but faded Belgrade club, Obilic, and within three years they were Yugoslav\\nchampions (what was left of Yugoslavia – in effect, Serbia and Montenegro). But the\\nmethods used in Obilic’s seemingly amazing rise to the top of the national tree were not\\nalways conventional, with stories abounding of referees being intimidated, opposition stars\\ndeveloping last-minute injuries that prevented them from playing, and in one case even a\\ndelayed kick-off on the last day of the season when both the title and relegation depended',\n",
       " 'on two matches, the delayed one involving Obilic.\\nArkan met his end in January 2000, when someone fired 38 shots through him in a\\nBelgrade café. His killer has never been found, which raises questions about whether the\\nassassination was somehow sanctioned. What is clear is that 2000 was the year football\\ndied for Slobodan Milosevic.\\nDespite the damage to his standing caused by the loss of the Serbs’ gains in the\\nCroatian and Bosnian wars, and the Nato bombing of 1999, the fear created by Milosevic’s\\ncommunist regime was still very much intact in the summer of 2000. But then something\\nhappened at a Red Star game. Red Star were playing Torpedo Kutaisi from Georgia in a\\nChampions League qualifying match. Whipped up by a 4–0 lead, the home fans started a\\nchant that can best be translated as: ‘Do Serbia a favour, Slobodan, and kill yourself.’ The\\npolice stepped in as tensions were ramped up, and at one stage, a Red Star flag was\\nseized by two police officers and trampled under foot. At that point, Red Star’s coach,\\nSlavoljub Muslin, spoke to the officers, got the flag off them and gave it back to the fans.\\nAlthough a tiny gesture, it was seized upon as a sign that Red Star were willing to stand up\\nto the Milosevic regime. After that, virtually every top-flight football match on Serbian\\nterritory became an anti-Milosovic rally, and with presidential elections due within two\\nmonths, the effect was \\nprofound. Sixty days after the Red Star v Torpedo Kutaisi match,\\nMilosevic lost the election and his attempts to cling to power were thwarted. Thus does the\\nDelije claim to have orchestrated the downfall of Milosevic and communism.\\nIf that’s not enough of a role for sport in the political fortunes of a nation, the football\\nwriter Jonathan Wilson believes it runs even deeper than that. He says Serbia has always\\nhad the Brazilian flair, the Serbs have always thought of themselves as ‘European\\nBrazilians’, and even nicknamed their main stadium in Belgrade the Marakana, copying\\nthe main football stadium in Rio de Janeiro. But he says it’s more than just copying a style\\nof football:\\nI suspect it comes from a slave mentality. A lot of Brazilians come from the former\\nenslaved peoples and survival as a slave meant adopting a mentality of cunning and\\ntrickery. It even finds its way into certain dances, and at times in Brazil it’s more\\nimportant to trick your opponent with a bit of clever footwork than it is to win the game.\\nThe southern Slavs have had a similar feeling of enslavement – for six centuries they\\nwere under the Ottoman Turks, and most of the history of Yugoslavia was a fight for\\nexistence in the face of the threat from Moscow. So I think the adopting of a lot of\\nBrazilian habits in football, even if it may be largely subconscious, tells us something\\nabout how the Serbs and other former Yugoslav peoples see themselves.\\nAn additional factor that might explain the feeling of enslavement is a theory among some\\nethnologists and linguists that the words ‘Slav’ and ‘slave’ have the same route. According\\nto this theory, Slavs became slaves around the beginning of the ninth century, and the\\nword ‘slave’ can be traced back through old English, old French and medieval Latin to the\\nsame word used by the early Slav peoples \\nto define themselves. Even if there’s no truth to\\nthis idea, the presence of the theory is enough to create an inferiority complex in those\\nlooking for one!\\nWilson extends his hypothesis to the extent of calling Yugoslavia, and particularly the\\nSerbs, ‘Europe’s most consistent chokers’ in football. He cites the fact that the Yugoslav\\nnational team and its leading club teams always seemed to fall at the last hurdle. But in\\none case it didn’t. Yugoslavia did in fact win the Under-18 football World Cup in 1988,\\nleading some to wonder whether the country broke up just as its golden age of football was',\n",
       " 'about to begin. But would Yugoslavia have done any better than Croatia did by coming\\nthird behind France and Brazil in the 1998 World Cup? No one will know, but past\\nexperience suggests probably not.\\nExtrapolating experience from Serbian football and transposing it on to tennis is a\\ndangerous game because the two cultures are so different. Two of the leading tennis clubs\\nare the tennis sections of Partizan and Red Star, and when they play each other at tennis,\\nthat too is known as ‘the eternal derby’, but there is vastly less sting in the tail than the\\nfootball derby. The tennis fan base is an altogether more genteel crowd than the football\\ncommunity.\\nBut in some ways, Djokovic has been a pacemaker for Serbian sport in the sense that he\\nhas broken the cycle that the Serbs are the perennial glorious losers. It’s easy to forget\\nthat, until about 2008, possibly even as late as 2010, there was a feeling on the tennis tour\\nthat the Serbs were quitters. Ivanovic and Jankovic had reached the top but had fallen\\nrapidly from it, Djokovic had won the Australian Open but not pushed on, and the men in\\ngeneral had a habit of often not allowing their opponents the achievement of winning –\\nthey often seemed to prefer to retire hurt from a match, rather than lose the final point (not\\njust Djokovic – the very cerebral Janko Tipsarevic has retired from 25 matches in his\\ncareer, tour-level and Challenger). Djokovic has turned that round by \\ncutting out most of\\nthe retirements and demonstrating an ability to dig deep in some incredibly punishing\\nmatches. If there is a ‘victim trait’ in Serbian sport and society, he has shown that it can be\\novercome. And it was interesting to see that Sinisa Mihajlovic, the passionately pro-Serb\\ncoach of the Serbian national football team, attended all three days of the 2013 Davis Cup\\nfinal to cheer on the Serbian national tennis team.\\n \\nIf the top five sports in Serbia are football, basketball, volleyball, handball and water polo,\\nit’s fair to ask where tennis comes now that four Serbs have topped the rankings and\\nIvanovic and Djokovic have become attractive icons for girls and boys. The answer is hard\\nto gauge. Being able to fill a 17,000-seater indoor stadium for Davis Cup ties is a\\nphenomenal achievement, but one-off events where people can tell their grandchildren\\nthat they saw the great Djokovic at the peak of his career are not a fair measurement of the\\ngeneral health of a sport. The Serbian Tennis Federation reported a 40 per cent increase\\nin demand for court space in the six months after Djokovic reached the 2007 French Open\\nquarter-finals, but will the current wave of interest last? We will probably only be able to\\njudge 10 years after the Djokovic generation retires, when it becomes clear how many\\nadults of working age want to play tennis having been inspired to take it up as kids\\nbecause of the Djokovic boom.\\nOne thing that needs correcting is the assumption that tennis in Serbia – even in the old\\nYugoslavia – began with Monica Seles, and that she and Djokovic are the first two big\\nnames. This is grossly unfair: indeed, the first national tennis association was founded in\\n1922 when the country was the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The royal family\\nwere keen tennis players, especially King Alexander I, who was assassinated in 1932.\\nAnd a leading player in the 1920s and 1930s was Mladen Stojamovic, who had been\\nGavrilo Princip’s principal accomplice in the assassination of \\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand in\\n1914, the act that triggered the outbreak of the First World War.\\nThere were a number of big names in the early years, such as Dora Alavantic, and the\\n1970s – the growth decade of professional tennis after the end of the split amateur and\\nprofessional circuits – had a number of prominent Yugoslavs. Nikki Pilic was at the centre\\nof the 1973 Wimbledon boycott, Mima Jausovec was the French Open champion in 1977',\n",
       " 'and Zoran Petkovic (the father of the German player Andrea Petkovic) was a national\\nchampion and played Davis Cup for Yugoslavia. Then in the 1980s Yugoslavia twice\\nreached the Davis Cup semi-finals, led by Slobodan Zivojinovic, and they did so for a third\\ntime in 1991 as Yugoslavia crumbled around them, the team of Zivojinovic (a Serb), Goran\\nIvanisevic and Goran Prpic (both Croats) breaking up after Yugoslavia’s quarter-final\\nvictory over Czechoslovakia, as the Serbo-Croat war gathered pace.\\nBy then, Monica Seles was world No. 1 in women’s tennis. An ethnic Hungarian from\\nNovi Sad in the north of Serbia, she won Yugoslavia’s second Grand Slam singles title\\n(after Mima Jausovec) when she became the youngest French Open champion in 1990 at\\nthe age of 16. What is interesting is that she was at the top of the world’s sporting\\nheadlines in 1992, the year the five-year-old Novak Djokovic really caught the tennis bug,\\nyet it was Pete Sampras’s Wimbledon triumph in July 1993 that Djokovic always cites as\\nmore of an inspiration, rather than his compatriot’s dominance of women’s tennis. Seles\\nwas the runaway world No. 1 when she was stabbed on court in Hamburg on 30 April\\n1993. Despite her lead in the rankings, she lost the No. 1 spot within five and a half weeks\\nto Steffi Graf, over whom Seles seemed to have a hold in big matches, certainly on hard\\nand clay courts.\\nAfter being coached by her father Karolij and also Jelena Gencic, the Seles family\\nmoved to Florida when Monica was 12, so she \\ncould be near the Bollettieri Tennis\\nAcademy in Bradenton. The family eventually applied for US citizenship and Seles got\\nhers in 1994, midway through the 27 months she missed of her playing career following\\nthe stabbing. It means eight of her nine major singles titles were won as a Yugoslav and\\nonly one as an American, but all nine were won with Sarasota, Florida very much her\\nhome and base.\\nSo while tennis was recognised in Serbia before the era of Zimonjic, Tipsarevic,\\nJankovic, Troicki, Ivanovic and Djokovic, and had a long-standing basis in Serbia’s\\nsporting culture, it was by no means a prominent sport. It’s therefore legitimate to view\\nSerbia’s golden generation a little like the emergence of soccer in America in the 1970s, or\\nthe emergence of rugby in Argentina or cycling in Great Britain – home-grown success in\\nthose sports raised the profile and participation level significantly but couldn’t topple the\\nexisting established sports from their places in the national sporting psyche. As such, the\\nfuture of tennis in Serbia may well depend on the post-Djokovic generation, as only the\\nability of the next lot to keep the fire burning will guarantee that tennis stays in the Serbian\\nsporting limelight when there’s no Djokovic to cheer and little chance of winning the Davis\\nCup.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER TWELVE\\n‘THIS IS WHAT I’M BORN FOR’\\nI\\nn the press conference that followed his Wimbledon victory in July 2011, Djokovic was\\nasked to comment on a statement his mother had made: that winning the Davis Cup for\\nSerbia seven months earlier taught him to play without fear. Djokovic replied, ‘Well, if my\\nmother says that, then it’s like that. There is nothing else I can say. My mother knows me\\nbetter than I know myself.’\\nIt’s easy to make the case that winning the Davis Cup freed up Djokovic and formed the\\nmissing piece in the jigsaw that allowed him to utterly dominate world tennis in 2011.\\nDjokovic half-makes that argument himself. ‘The Davis Cup title came in the right moment,’\\nhe says. ‘I believe that title, that feeling of sharing one of the biggest titles in our sport with\\nmy team for our country, in our country, was one of the best feelings I experienced as a\\ntennis player on the court. That was a great confidence boost and helped me to believe in\\nmyself, to believe more in my abilities on the court.’\\nBut that would be too simple an explanation for his \\nannus mirabilis\\n of 2011. There were\\nseveral ‘last pieces of the jigsaw’, of which the gluten-free diet he discovered in mid-2010\\nwas certainly one (whether actual or only in the mind – the health professionals are divided\\nbut his belief in the gluten-free diet was clearly of huge significance to his well-being), and\\nrediscovering the rhythm on his serve was another. To that can be added a whole range of\\nlittle things, from the orthotics in his shoes to the calm but authoritative backroom team\\npresided over by Marian Vajda. And at the age of 23, he had a greater wealth of\\nexperience, including a more mature relationship with his father that gave him the sense of\\nbeing in control of his own life, rather than having it run for him.\\nYet it’s important to remember that there were people at the start of 2011 who felt\\nDjokovic may have peaked. He had won the Australian Open at 20, but since then he had\\nspent three years clearly behind Federer and Nadal at the top of the game. Coming from a\\ncountry where team sports were valued more importantly than individual sports, his biggest\\npriority – so the hypothesis went – may well have been the Davis Cup. And with Andy\\nMurray establishing himself as a member of the elite, there was no guarantee that Djokovic\\nhad a natural right to ascend to the world No. 1’s throne when the fortunes of the great duo\\nbegan to wane. So while it may look, with the benefit of hindsight, like the most natural\\nprogression, Djokovic’s wonderful 2011 was by no means a given at the start of it.\\nHe was, perhaps, a shade lucky in not having to face Nadal at Melbourne Park. Nadal\\nwent to Australia looking to hold all four major titles concurrently but he was undone by his\\nleft hamstring in the quarter-finals. Facing his compatriot David Ferrer, who has always\\nseemed to lack belief against Nadal in Grand Slam matches, Nadal called for the trainer\\nafter three games and he left the court for treatment. Although he finished the match, it was\\nclear he couldn’t move at anything like his normal level, and Ferrer’s \\nstraight-sets win took\\nplace in a somewhat bemused atmosphere, where no one at Melbourne Park could quite\\ntake what they were seeing at face value. In his post-match press conference, Nadal\\nrefused to talk about any injury, except for one hint that he couldn’t move that well. It was\\nan approach that divided the tennis community into those who felt it was all rather a fake\\nand those who respected the dignity with which he refused to blame an injury for fear of\\nundermining one of the best results of a fellow professional’s career.',\n",
       " 'Perhaps Djokovic’s biggest victory at that tournament was in beating Federer in the\\nsemi-finals. Thought of very much as a 50:50 beforehand, Djokovic outplayed Federer with\\nhis superb footwork. Federer was starting to put into practice the coaching of Paul\\nAnnacone, notably Annacone’s suggestion that he play closer to the baseline to rob his\\nopponent of vital split seconds. But every time Federer drove Djokovic wide, the Serb was\\nthere with blistering groundstrokes that would be anatomically impossible for players with\\nlesser ankles, and the Serb won in three tight but clear sets. Interestingly, Djokovic favours\\nhis left foot when kicking a football, so it could be that he has an unusually strong left foot\\nwhich allows him a firmer base than other players have for hitting big backhands when at\\nfull stretch.\\nHe lost just nine games against Murray in the final. It’s possible the real story of that final\\nhas never been fully told. Just before the walk on court, a tournament official wished\\nMurray well, to which Murray muttered misanthropically, ‘Hopefully, I can get through it.’\\nThe Scot had been suffering from back problems throughout that fortnight, and while it’s\\nhard to know what exactly to read into his rather pained body language when he’s losing\\n(until recently, Murray seldom lost a match without looking as if he was suffering greatly),\\nhe certainly didn’t seem to be at full fitness. And there was almost a sense of relief for\\nMurray that he hadn’t lost \\nembarrassingly. Invited on a couple of subsequent occasions to\\nsay whether there was anything hindering him that day, Murray has always denied it, but\\nNadal may have established a convention among the top players: not to blame an injury for\\na defeat to an opponent they respect.\\nAnd maybe Murray was beaten, at least in part, by the growing realisation that Djokovic\\nwas something of a born-again player. Six months later, Djokovic was to say, ‘After the\\nDavis Cup win I was full of life, full of energy, eager to come back to the tennis court, eager\\nto play some more, win some other tournaments. In a sentence, I lost my fear. I believed in\\nmy abilities more than ever. Australia was one of the best tournaments I played in my life.’\\nYet the biggest obstacle to Djokovic dominating tennis was the fact that he lacked self-\\nbelief against Federer and Nadal. ‘I had too much respect for them,’ he has since admitted.\\nHe had no difficulty believing he could beat everyone else, but there was a psychological\\nblock against the top two – certainly against Nadal.\\nGiven that admission, perhaps the real work in the \\nannus mirabilis\\n was done in the finals\\nof the four ATP Masters-1000 tournaments leading up to the French Open. Over more than\\na decade, the ATP has done its best to market its top nine tour-level tournaments as a\\nspecial series, a bit like the European Champions League in football, and they do stand\\nout from the rest of the 60-odd tour-level events that make up the men’s professional circuit.\\nBut they have always struggled to get close to the four majors, and in terms of financial\\nturnover the gap is getting bigger, not smaller. Yet for Djokovic in 2011, they were more\\nthan just warm-up events. In the finals of Indian Wells, Miami, Madrid and Rome, he\\nprepared the ground for his final climb to the top.\\nIn the first half of 2011 there was a strange triangle at the top of the men’s game. Nadal\\nclearly had the edge over Federer; in fact, Federer, for all his dominance, has not beaten\\nNadal at a major \\nsince the 2007 Wimbledon final. Federer still felt he could beat Djokovic,\\nthough Djokovic’s emphatic win at the Australian Open had made their rivalry very much\\neven. So being able to beat Nadal was the key to Djokovic’s assault on the summit.\\nHis victory in the final of Indian Wells was a boost, but it’s hard to read too much into\\nresults at Indian Wells. Although the tennis facility built by the former player Charlie\\nPasarell is quite superb, the setting is a slightly rarefied one, in that it’s part of a retirement\\ncommunity, making the average age of the spectators higher than elsewhere on the tour. In',\n",
       " 'addition, the ball can sometimes fly in the Californian desert, so freak results can never be\\nruled out. In retrospect, there was nothing freakish about Djokovic beating Federer in the\\nsemis (his third victory in three tournaments over the Swiss, having beaten him in the final\\nof Dubai a fortnight after Melbourne), but at the time, Djokovic just looked like a player in\\nform.\\nWhen he beat Nadal in Miami on a final set tie-break, the tennis world sat up a little\\nmore. Beating the clear world No. 1 twice in successive finals was becoming a statement,\\nbut Nadal’s best surface was still to come.\\nDjokovic skipped Monte Carlo, but after picking up a second title at his own tournament\\nin Belgrade, he played the back-to-back Masters events in Madrid and Rome, the home\\nstraight of the run-up to the French Open. By now people were talking about his amazing\\nunbeaten streak. Going into Madrid it was 28 matches in the year and 30 since his last\\ndefeat (to Federer at the ATP Finals). When he beat Nadal 7–5, 6–4 in the final, the tennis\\nworld was sitting bolt upright – it was his first ever victory against the Spaniard on clay and\\nNadal had been beaten in a clay-court final for only the third time. But again there were\\nslightly mitigating circumstances. Nadal has never been totally comfortable in Madrid,\\nwhere the altitude makes the ball fly more \\nquickly through the air, and the Caja Magica\\ntennis stadium often seems to help those players who play best on hard courts. That’s why\\nthe real damage Djokovic did to the Nadal psyche took place in Rome. This had been\\nsomething of a stronghold for Nadal – he had won back-to-back five-set finals in the days\\nwhen the final was played over the full distance, and the conditions were much more\\nsimilar to Roland Garros than Madrid had been. So when Djokovic beat Nadal 6–4, 6–4 in\\nthe final, he suddenly became a joint favourite for Paris.\\nWhat was Djokovic doing? He and his team had identified that Nadal’s incredibly heavy\\ntopspin allowed him to play relatively safe, in the sense that he didn’t need to hit into the\\nlast half-metre of the court – a three-quarter-length shot with heavy topspin that made the\\nball almost explode off the surface could often do the same damage. So Djokovic stepped\\nin to make use of the shorter ball. He had always been a player to play largely on his\\nbaseline but now he stepped even further into the court to take the ball early and rob Nadal\\nof vital seconds. It was a high-risk strategy, as it made him vulnerable to having to play\\nballs off his shoelaces when they were hit deep, but with Nadal’s game built around\\nphenomenal speed and retrieving ability, it was worth the chance to rush the Spaniard.\\nAnd once the strategy began to work, the psychological dividend kicked in, as Nadal felt\\nthe need to hit deeper when he got a softer ball, and frequently overhit.\\nBy the time the Roland Garros semi-finals came round, Djokovic’s unbeaten streak was\\nup to 45 matches. But on a glorious if gusty spring day in Paris, the streak came to an end\\non one of the best days of tennis played in the history of the sport.\\nAfter Nadal had celebrated his 25th birthday by beating Andy Murray in the first semi-\\nfinal, everyone was expecting the Nadal-Djokovic final that would crown the series of their\\nfour Masters finals. Djokovic took to the court against Federer knowing that \\nvictory would\\ntake him to the world No. 1 ranking. But it was to be the day Federer breathed life into his\\nfaltering career in the match of the tennis year. He not only served well but he had a game\\nplan that he carried out with great intelligence. When Federer won Wimbledon 13 months\\nlater in July 2012, he traced his revival back to the win over Djokovic in Paris, the one that\\ngave him belief that he could still hold his own with the best.\\nAlthough the record books have it as a four-sets win for Federer, that doesn’t show how\\nclose Djokovic came. Having dropped the first two sets, he rallied back to take the third,\\nand when he served for the fourth at 5–4, the daylight was disappearing to such an extent',\n",
       " 'that they looked dead set to come back on the Saturday morning to play a one-set\\nshootout. In that, Djokovic would surely have been a clear favourite, but it didn’t get that far.\\nFederer played a superb game to break back, and as the level of tennis rose in tandem\\nwith the rapidly fading light, he held his nerve to take the tie-break 7–5 on his third match\\npoint.\\nDjokovic was gracious in defeat. He recognised that his great run would have to end\\nsomewhere and that he had been part of a great sporting spectacle, but it still hurt for him\\nto lose his winning run in such a high-stakes match. The run was over but a feature of the\\nSerb’s career has been his ability to accept that a defeat has gone, regroup and come back\\nstronger. He wisely realised that he needed a break after Paris, so reneged on his\\ncommitment to play at London’s Queen’s Club and was next in action at Wimbledon.\\nHis Wimbledon draw was not without pitfalls. Kevin Anderson, Marcos Baghdatis and\\nMichael Llodra all had the potential to hurt him, but he reached the quarter-finals for the\\nloss of a single set. A four-sets win over the 18-year-old Australian Bernard Tomic should\\nhave set up a repeat of the Paris semi-final against Federer but the Swiss was beaten from\\ntwo sets up by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. For the second successive major, Djokovic went into\\nhis semi-final knowing \\nthat victory would give him the No. 1 ranking. This time he didn’t\\nfalter – he beat the Frenchman in a highly entertaining four-setter to set up a final against\\nNadal, who recovered from a poor start to beat Andy Murray in the other semi-final. The top\\nspot Djokovic had dreamed about as a child was his, but the question was whether he\\nwould celebrate it with the biggest individual title of his career or as a consolation for\\nhaving to make do with the Wimbledon runner-up prize.\\nThis was the match where the four Masters-1000 finals really paid their dividend. It\\nhelped that Djokovic played some of his best tennis in the first two sets; in fact, some of the\\npoints in the second set were breathtaking. At times he seemed to be toying with Nadal,\\nand when the score stood at 6–4, 6–1 for the Serb, it was almost like a dream sequence.\\nBut could it last? Djokovic’s level visibly went down at the start of the third set. It was no\\ndisgrace – few players could have kept up the level he’d shown in the first hour – but\\nNadal capitalised and broke. When he broke again and took the third set 6–1, he was back\\non track to repeat his remarkable Paris-Wimbledon double from 2008 and 2010.\\nDjokovic was perhaps a little lucky to break early in the fourth, but it was what happened\\nafter that that was most remarkable. Nadal is human, he makes mistakes, but he hardly\\never makes them on big points – record the first four games of any Nadal set and you’ll find\\nsome errors, but record the last two of any set and there are very few. But as the fourth set\\nwore on, he made more and more errors. Djokovic wasn’t playing badly but nor had he\\nrediscovered his level from the first two sets. It was as if the work done in those four\\nMasters-1000 finals was eating away at Nadal, and the seemingly indestructible\\ncompetitor almost self-destructed.\\n‘I was trying to take myself back to the four matches where I’d beaten him,’ Djokovic\\nexplained later. ‘I had that in the back of my mind. I was trying to perform the same way:\\naggressive, taking my \\nchances, not giving him opportunity to take over the control.’ Easily\\nsaid but much harder to do. The fourth set was a feast of scrambling, with the noise level\\nfrom both players’ grunting rising with the tension of the match. But what Djokovic did on\\nseveral occasions was to throw in a soft ball after a succession of big baseline shots, and\\non most of them Nadal went for too much and overhit. That was the psychological damage\\nDjokovic had inflicted from the four victorious finals. Nadal even got the break back and\\nserved at 3–4 to get back on level terms, but Djokovic broke him again and thus served for\\nthe Wimbledon title.',\n",
       " 'At 5–3, 30–30, after a long baseline rally that had gone to Nadal, Djokovic threw in a\\nchange of tactic. He served out wide and volleyed the return into the open court at full pace\\non the backhand. If the strategy had misfired and he’d been broken and lost the match,\\npeople might well have pinpointed that move and said that was where he blew it. It could\\nhave happened, but at that point, Djokovic knew he had his man on the ropes and it was\\nworth the risk to try and ram home his advantage. On the next point he again came to the\\nnet, though not behind the serve, but he didn’t have to play the volley as Nadal’s backhand\\nsailed out.\\nDjokovic fell to the turf and moments later even ate a mouthful of grass, saying he ‘felt\\nlike an animal’.\\nWas this what he imagined when, as a seven-year-old, he found a plastic vase and\\npretended it was the Wimbledon trophy? He’s not the only kid to dream of winning\\nWimbledon but one of the few who has the drive and the determination to go on to realise\\nthat dream, so did he think of his childhood dreams at the point of victory? ‘I did,’ he said.\\n‘When I finished the match, when I ate the piece of grass, I had a flashback of my whole\\nchildhood, what I’ve been through, memories, first tennis courts that I grew up on, days\\nspent in Belgrade. It was beautiful.’\\nAn hour later when he faced the assembled tennis media in his \\npost-final press\\nconference, he was more considered but still effusive.\\nThis is what I’m born for, to be a tennis champion. I was just chatting with my brothers\\nand my family and my team in the locker room, just kind of remembering those days of\\nthe hard work that we put in in Germany and back in Serbia when I was eight, nine,\\nten, eleven years old, the dreams I had. It’s really beautiful. I mean, this success kind\\nof makes you rewind the old days, makes you come back to your childhood and\\nremember what you’ve been through to get to this stage. It wasn’t an easy way but I\\nguess that’s necessary in order for you to fight for what you want to achieve. We all\\nknow the situation in our country, how it was with the wars and things like that. It was\\ndefinitely really difficult to become a tennis professional, with tennis being not one of\\nthe most popular sports in our country. It didn’t have any history. But then [at] the end\\nof the day, now when you think about it, that’s something that we needed. Not just\\nmyself but Ana Ivanovic, Jankovic, Tipsarevic, Zimonjic – all these players who have\\nbeen successful these last couple of years in men’s and women’s tennis, we had a\\ntough way to go through. That made us mentally strong.\\nDjokovic also made the statement, ‘I’m going to celebrate like a Serb’, which went down\\nwell with the British who liked the sound of it, even if they didn’t really know what it meant\\n(could a well-oiled Brit really imagine Djokovic singing Serbian folk songs as a way of\\ncelebrating?). Back home in Belgrade, an estimated 100,000 fans turned out to greet him\\nin a pop-concert-like reception in Republic Square. He rode in an open-topped bus from\\nNikola Tesla Airport to the city centre with his replica of the Wimbledon trophy, waving to\\nfans who lined the route.\\nIn the days after his Wimbledon title, there were instances of kids fixing up ropes\\nbetween two posts and finding two bits of wood and a rubber ball with which they would\\npretend to play tennis. It would be wrong to read into this the birth of a popular sport in\\nSerbia, but it was a reflection of a national hero and children traditionally like to ape their\\nidols – this particular idol played a sport that was largely unknown in Serbia but he was no\\nless an idol for it.\\nWhatever he had achieved back home, in tennis terms he had shaken up the',\n",
       " 'establishment. Given how the decade starting around 2004–5 has become the\\nFederer/Nadal/Djokovic era, it’s easy to forget what a massive sea change Djokovic’s win\\nat Wimbledon represented. Since Gaston Gaudio’s almost freakish win at the French Open\\nin 2004, just three men (Marat Safin, Juan Martin del Potro and Djokovic) had stopped\\nFederer and Nadal duopolising the 28 major singles titles up for grabs. Djokovic was not\\njust world No. 1, he had beaten Federer and Nadal eight times in nine matches in the\\nprevious six months. He had broken the Federer-Nadal bank.\\n \\nBy the time Djokovic left Wimbledon, he’d played 49 matches in 2011 and won 48 of them.\\nHaving achieved two of his biggest goals in the last three days of Wimbledon (the No. 1\\nranking and the Wimbledon title) and three in the previous seven months if you count the\\nDavis Cup, he could have been forgiven for losing some of his bite in the remainder of the\\nyear. But he said after Wimbledon, ‘I want to win more Grand Slams, I will definitely not\\nstop here,’ and he strolled through his first tournament back, the Canadian Masters in\\nMontreal, and was only prevented from winning the Cincinnati Masters when a shoulder\\ninjury caused him to retire at 0-3 down in the second set to Andy Murray.\\nThat created a couple of days of speculation about whether the \\nman of the year would\\nbe able to play in the US Open, but the withdrawal in Cincinnati was largely precautionary,\\nand Djokovic was fully fit by the time the US Open began just over a week later. More than\\nthat, he was trying out a new health gizmo. As the US Open got under way, the \\nWall Street\\nJournal\\n reported that Djokovic was spending three lots of 20 minutes a week in ‘an egg-\\nshape, bobsled-sized pressure chamber’. Many players spend time in hyperbaric\\nenvironments, which put more oxygen in the blood to allow them to recover from punishing\\nmatches, but this was supposed to be vastly superior to your bog-standard hyperbaric\\nchamber. It was made by a Californian company, CVAC Systems, who claimed its $75,000\\ncontraption could enhance athletic performance ‘by improving circulation, boosting\\noxygen-rich red-blood cells, removing lactic acid and possibly even stimulating\\nmitochondrial biogenesis and stem-cell production’. It made for a good story and Djokovic\\nwas happy to say he was using it, but when asked 16 months later whether he had one\\nwith him in Australia, he said he had only made ‘limited use’ of the chamber in the USA.\\nHe certainly looked fully fit at Flushing Meadows, dropping just 12 games in his first\\nthree matches. Things got steadily tougher after that, with a 16–14 tie-break against\\nAlexandr Dolgopolov, a gruelling four-setter against his Davis Cup team-mate Janko\\nTipsarevic in the quarter-finals and another bruising five-setter against Roger Federer in\\nthe semis.\\nFor the second year running, Djokovic saved two match points, but this victory was\\nalmost a steal. Federer had dominated for the first two sets as Djokovic had struggled to\\nfind his rhythm. Federer broke to lead 5–3 in the final set, and at 5–4, 40–15, he had two\\nmatch points. On the first of them, Djokovic went for a gamble with a big forehand return of\\nserve and made it with a spectacular clean winner. It was clear from the post-match press\\nconferences that this \\nwinner had outpsyched Federer. Perhaps it was Djokovic raising\\nboth arms to the crowd to milk some support after most of the fans had been shamelessly\\npro-Federer from the start, perhaps it was the fact that the gamble had paid off, perhaps it\\nwas the cheeky smile Djokovic delivered as he prepared to return serve on the second\\nmatch point. Whatever it was, Federer netted a forehand on the second match point and\\nwas a broken man after that. In his post-match news conference Federer seemed almost to\\nimply that going for such a gamble on match point was disrespectful. His comments\\nprobably shouldn’t be taken too literally, as the disappointment must have been',\n",
       " 'overwhelming, but it made the point that Djokovic had not just outpsyched Nadal but could\\noutpsyche Federer too. ‘I didn’t want to have him do to me here what he did at the French\\nOpen,’ Djokovic said.\\nThat set up another clash with Nadal, their second successive final both at the US Open\\nand in the majors. Fortunately for Djokovic, this ill-fated US Open, which had had to deal\\nwith earthquakes, hurricanes and water seeping through cracks in court surfaces, had to\\ngo to a third Monday, giving him more time to recover from his five-setter against Federer,\\nand in another physical match the extra time was probably crucial. Nadal had sounded an\\nominous warning at Wimbledon. ‘When one player beats me five times, it is because my\\ngame doesn’t bother him a lot,’ he’d said after the final. ‘I have to try to find solutions and\\nthat’s what I’m going to try.’ Nadal was to find those solutions (a word he uses a lot in\\nEnglish) but it was to take him until the following year. In fact, the US Open final followed a\\nremarkably similar pattern to the Wimbledon final.\\nHistory records that Djokovic beat Nadal 6–2, 6–4, 6–7, 6–1, but the numbers don’t\\nreflect the brutal physicality of the spectacle and the breathtaking nature of some of the\\nrallies. This was tennis at its closest to boxing, and while the two men played a longer final\\nin \\nMelbourne four months later, this was at least as physical, if not more so, even if it did\\nlast ‘only’ just over four hours.\\nThe big similarity with Wimbledon was in Nadal falling away in the fourth set when he\\nhad every reason to be mounting a comeback. Djokovic had served for the title at 6-5 in the\\nthird set, but Nadal had broken back with some of the best tennis of the match and had\\nthen never been behind in the tie-break. Djokovic then took a medical timeout at the end of\\nthe third set to have some tightening muscles in his back loosened. Yet with everything\\nlined up for Nadal to muscle his way physically and psychologically back into the match,\\nhe fell away. There weren’t the errors that had characterised his fourth-set collapse at\\nWimbledon, but he did allow Djokovic to play and the Serb took full advantage. When he\\nhit an in-to-out forehand to win the match and fall to his back on the concrete, he had\\nreaffirmed the message he had confirmed at Wimbledon – that he was the world’s best and\\nhad not only joined but eclipsed the Federer-Nadal duopoly.\\n \\nIn the remaining two-and-a-half months of the year, nothing of note was added to the body\\nof work that makes up Djokovic’s \\nannus mirabilis\\n of 2011.\\nHe wasn’t helped by a scheduling conflict that is understandable but counterproductive.\\nSeveral years ago, the International Tennis Federation asked the players which weeks\\nthey would prefer for Davis Cup ties. The popular response was the week after the majors,\\nwhich makes sense for most of them, as even a good run at a major means they will be out\\nof the tournament by the second Tuesday, which gives them 10 days to prepare for\\nrepresenting their country. Mindful of its need to keep the players on-side, the ITF\\nacquiesced and has two of its four Davis Cup weekends a year in the week after Slams.\\nBut that is a terrible week for the marquee names, who find \\nthemselves in Grand Slam\\nsemi-finals and finals on Friday/Saturday and Sunday (or sometimes Monday) and then\\nhave to play a vital singles just a few days later, often on a different surface, often on a\\ndifferent continent. So having just won his first US Open in a brutal four-hour final on\\nMonday night, Djokovic was due on court barely three days later in Belgrade as Serbia\\ntook on Argentina in the Davis Cup semi-final. Rumours abounded that he had an injury,\\nbut you didn’t have to be a conspiracy theorist to accept the wisdom of throwing Janko\\nTipsarevic and Viktor Troicki into singles action on the opening day, to give Djokovic two\\nmore days to recover.',\n",
       " 'The problem for Serbia was that Troicki was ranked higher than Tipsarevic, so played at\\nNo. 1, but his form was on a downward trend. And when David Nalbandian beat him in four\\nsets, it put Serbia on the back foot, especially as Juan Martin del Potro beat Tipsarevic as\\nexpected. Troicki and Zimonjic’s win in the doubles kept the tie alive and paved the way\\nfor Djokovic to have the hero’s welcome that his exploits during the year warranted.\\nOn Sunday afternoon he walked out into the Beogradska Arena to the kind of welcome\\nvery few people experience. Wearing his red Serbia shirt proudly, almost defiantly, he\\nmarched through the dry ice into the arena, highlighted by a spotlight amid dimmed lights,\\naccompanied by the strains of \\nCarmina Burana\\n as 17,000 fans screamed wildly. It was the\\nkind of reception normally reserved for pop stars and prize-fight boxers. If anyone could\\nturn the semi-final round for Serbia, Djokovic could.\\nAll went well for a set, but Djokovic couldn’t break free from the tall Argentinean. To beat\\ndel Potro you have to return well, and Djokovic’s blistering returns were absent without\\nleave. Normally he can run for an hour or two and get himself into the groove, but how\\nmuch gas did he have in the tank? The set went into the tie-break, and although Djokovic\\ngot a mini-break back to level at 4–4, he lost the tie-break 7–5.\\nSo what happens now? Here was the hero of Serbia, clearly not fully fit, understandably\\nvery tired, having played for an hour and still in need of three sets. Something in Djokovic’s\\nsubconscious must have given way at that point. He lost his serve lamely to go 0–2 down\\nand, as del Potro drove Djokovic wide to his forehand side on the point for 3–0, Djokovic\\nwent down with a scream of anguish and lay motionless on the ground. The exact same\\nthing had happened a year earlier, but if that was partly tactical to get into Tomas\\nBerdych’s head, this was tactical only in the sense that he knew he couldn’t go another\\nthree sets to give Serbia a chance of victory in the fifth rubber.\\nSuch phrasing makes it sound as if the injury was a fake. It wasn’t. It emerged that he did\\nhave a tear in a back muscle that he’d picked up at the US Open. He knew he had a\\nchance of aggravating it if he played against del Potro but he calculated he would have a\\nbetter chance of beating the former US Open champion than Troicki had. In that he was\\nalmost certainly right, but in retrospect he had to win the first set. Once that was gone, the\\ngame was up and something in the deeper reaches of his being rescued him by sparing\\nhim the remainder of a lost cause. As many people are happy to admit, he was willing to\\ntry, whereas most players in his position would have considered the risk of aggravating the\\ninjury wasn’t worth it. He had a 4–0 record against del Potro going into the match and\\nsurely no one could begrudge him the hero’s walk on court at the start. ‘It was my decision\\nbut the gamble backfired,’ he said, which is a fair assessment. It was Serbia’s first defeat in\\nthe Beogradska Arena and was to remain the only one until a weakened team lost the\\n2013 final.\\nAfter that, his stellar year fizzled out somewhat. He suffered some defeats that were\\nmore the result of anti-climax and fatigue than an opponent playing better tennis, and he\\nhad the sense of fun to walk on court for a match in Basel on 31 October dressed in a\\nHallowe’en mask, complete with a shock of black hair. His willingness to do that – to\\ndispense with the ‘game face’ at a phase of the match where he would normally have been\\nso focused and serious – suggests he felt his year’s work was done, which it effectively\\nwas.\\nHe finished the year as the runaway No. 1. He had broken the Federer-Nadal duopoly\\nand he received a raft of awards. The most prestigious was the Laureus World Sportsman\\nof the Year. This is an award that ought to be the pinnacle of global sporting recognition,\\nand it probably is, although it does seem to have a bias towards tennis that takes a little of',\n",
       " 'its credibility away. Maybe it is just that tennis is enjoying an extraordinary era with\\nFederer, Nadal, Djokovic and Serena Williams, but there is always a sense that the best in\\na year in tennis is always going to feature in the Laureus Awards.\\nNonetheless, Djokovic was a worthy winner when he stepped up to receive his award\\nthe week after his endurance marathon at the 2012 Australian Open. ‘It’s really difficult to\\ndescribe in words how much this means to me,’ he said, before adding significantly, ‘not\\njust me but my family, my team, my country, all the people who’ve been supporting me\\nthroughout my whole career.’ It is common practice at trophy-presentation ceremonies for\\nplayers to thank their team, and many thank their family. But few thank their country. Novak\\nDjokovic had conquered the world in 2011 – he had done what he said he would when his\\nage was still in single digits. And he had done it as much for his country as for himself.\\n \\nHow was he ever going to follow his achievements of 2011 in 2012? It’s easy to look back\\nand say 2011 was as good as it was going to get, and that may well prove the case in the\\ncourse of Djokovic’s whole career. But although he lost the No. 1 ranking mid-way through\\n2012, he ended the year as the world’s top player, reached \\nthree of the four Grand Slam\\nfinals and added to his legend with a remarkable third Australian Open title. He also spent\\nmost of 2013 at the top of the rankings, and while he was pipped by Nadal in October, he\\nended the year playing the best tennis, including two drubbings of Nadal in October and\\nNovember. It would therefore be wrong to put 2012 and 2013 too far behind 2011 – fairer\\nwould be to say that from the start of 2011 Djokovic was the world’s most consistent tennis\\nplayer for the subsequent three-plus years.\\nHis Australian Open title in January 2012 may well go down as his single biggest\\nachievement. He played four hours, 50 minutes in his semi-final on the second Friday night\\nof the tournament, beating Andy Murray 7–5 in the fifth set. Many thought Murray had done\\nenough to set Nadal up for an easy win in the final by draining Djokovic’s resources of\\nenergy, especially after Nadal had beaten Roger Federer on Thursday evening in more\\nthan an hour less. But that weekend Djokovic proved that draining his reserves is well-nigh\\nimpossible.\\nThe first week of a Grand Slam often seems a formality for the big names. They can’t win\\nthe title in the first week, they can only lose it, but the first week of this one was remarkably\\nimportant for Djokovic’s chances. He expended the minimum of energy, dropping just 14\\ngames in his first 11 sets of the tournament and reaching the semis having conceded just\\none set, which was to Lleyton Hewitt in the fourth round. So while he played two punishing\\nmatches in the space of 48 hours at the end, his larder was well stocked going into the\\nsharp end of the tournament.\\nIt was again a case of the big four reaching the semis. Federer took Nadal to five sets but\\nnever seriously looked like winning, while the Djokovic-Murray encounter was a genuine\\n50:50. Towards the end of the final set, Murray often looked the likelier winner, but\\nDjokovic had the confidence of his stellar 2011 and edged the victory.\\nThen came the match that was certainly the longest final in Grand Slam history, probably\\nthe most physical and, at least towards the end, one of the best in terms of quality. Djokovic\\nwas slow to get going, as he often is against Nadal, and found himself a set down after just\\nover an hour. But he bounced back in the second, and throughout the third and most of the\\nfourth he looked distinctly the stronger player. But Nadal came back at the end of the fourth\\nset after a short rain delay and snatched the set on the tie-break. With the tournament now\\ninto its third week and the final going past midnight, Nadal looked the stronger. He broke\\nfor 4–2 but Djokovic got the break straight back. That signalled another momentum swing,',\n",
       " 'and when Djokovic broke for 6–5, he was serving for the match. If Nadal had seized the\\nbreak point he had to get back to 6–6, the momentum might easily have swung again, but\\nDjokovic saved it with a boldly angled backhand and then sealed victory with a serve that\\nleft Nadal stranded, allowing the Serb to hit an in-to-out forehand to end the match.\\nThe match time was five hours, 53 minutes, and after embracing Nadal and shaking\\nhands with the umpire, Pascal Maria, Djokovic ripped off his shirt, his inner animal finally\\nreleased from captivity. His celebration was almost frightening – he walked bare-chested\\nacross the court to his entourage, clenched both fists with a primeval scream, and after\\nshaking a few hands, thumped an advertising hoarding several times before retreating\\nback to his chair. You wouldn’t have wanted to meet him in a bad mood when he tapped\\ninto that energy.\\nTennis relies on its sponsors, but the farce of having the chief executive of Kia Motors,\\nthe principal sponsor of the Australian Open, giving a three-minute speech at almost 2am\\nafter the two players had provided nearly six hours of scintillating tennis was painful to\\nwatch. It was only when the second of the speeches, given by the president of Tennis\\nAustralia, began that someone twigged \\nthat Nadal and Djokovic were suffering physically\\nas they waited for their trophies. Eventually, the tournament director, Craig Tiley, signalled\\nto some court staff to get the players chairs, a gesture that elicited the biggest applause of\\nthe awards ceremony before the players were allowed to take centre stage again. Within\\nthe hour, the two players were sitting in ambulances in the dock of the Rod Laver Arena,\\nboth of them on intravenous drips and being monitored, while the ‘bump out’ operation to\\ndismantle the arena as a tennis stadium took place around them.\\nInevitably, Djokovic was asked after the match whether it was the greatest win of his\\ncareer. ‘I think it comes out on top,’ he said, ‘because just the fact that we played almost six\\nhours is incredible. I’m very proud just to be part of this history, part of the elite players that\\nhave won this tournament several times. I was very flattered to be playing in front of Rod\\nLaver, in front of the all-time greats, and in front of 15,000 people that stayed until one-thirty\\n[in the morning].’ Given the dictates of the media and the journalist’s quest to write the first\\ndraft of history, it was understandable that he should be asked to assess his victory, but a\\nmore considered assessment will have to wait until the end of his career. What is certain is\\nthat, even if he never wins another major title, Djokovic’s heroics that night in Melbourne\\nguarantee him his place among the great athletes in world sport.\\n \\nAny assessment of Djokovic’s achievements in 2012 and 2013 risks falling into the trap of\\nnot having enough elapsed time to assess the true magnitude of them. Despite the\\nblistering start in Australia, he was never going to repeat what he achieved in 2011 – true,\\nRoger Federer won three majors out of four in three years out of four (2004, 2006, 2007)\\nbut he had an almost effortless style of playing that took much less out of him than Djokovic\\nand Nadal. The fact that Djokovic ended 2012 as world No. 1, having lost the top \\nranking\\nin mid-year and ended 2013 playing clearly the best tennis, even if he was pipped in the\\nrankings by the returning Nadal, will probably mean history judges him the world’s best\\nplayer over the period 2011–13, and possibly longer, but we just can’t tell at this stage as\\nwe’re still too close.\\nThere was a marked difference between the Djokovic of the European springtime in\\n2012 and the one from 2011. In April he played Monte Carlo, a tournament he’d missed the\\nprevious year, and reached the final, where he played Nadal. That Nadal won 6–3, 6–1 to\\nturn the tables on the pattern of the previous year was not the story. Djokovic’s grandfather,\\nVlada (Vladimir Djokovic), died midweek after a long illness. Djokovic received the news',\n",
       " 'as he warmed up on the morning of his match against Alexandr Dolgopolov and was\\nclearly very upset. He was all over the place in the first set against the mercurial Ukrainian\\nand was perhaps lucky to be playing an opponent who has yet to show he has as much\\nsteel as he has talent. Djokovic bounced back to win in straight sets, and then beat Robin\\nHaase and Tomas Berdych before losing to Nadal.\\n‘I definitely don’t want to take away anything from Rafa’s win,’ said Djokovic in his post-\\nmatch news conference, ‘but it’s a fact that I didn’t have any emotional energy left in me. I\\njust wasn’t there. I’ve never been caught up in this kind of emotional situation before. It’s\\nbeen a very difficult week for me to go through mentally. I won three matches since the\\nnews. I mean, I think I did pretty well.’ Given that this was the grandfather who acted at\\ntimes as a third parent, whose flat served as a shelter for the entire family during the\\nBelgrade bombing of 1999 and who is reported to have funded some of the tennis facilities\\nthe Djokovics set up after it became clear they had a prodigy on their hands, it was\\ngenerally thought to be a legitimate excuse for winning just four games in a Masters Series\\nfinal. Yet, regardless of the circumstances, Nadal had the psychological win he needed,\\nand when he also beat Djokovic 7–5, \\n6–3 in the Rome final four weeks later, he had the\\nform in Masters finals going into the peak Grand Slam season that Djokovic had enjoyed\\nthe previous year.\\nDjokovic’s US Open triumph meant the French Open was the last of the four majors he\\nhad yet to win. With Federer having completed his set in 2009, and Nadal in 2010, it’s easy\\nfor modern-day fans to think achieving a ‘career Grand Slam’ is just a milestone that all top\\nplayers go through. But it’s an extremely difficult accomplishment to pull off. Prior to\\nFederer, only two players had done it with all players eligible to complete: Rod Laver and\\nAndre Agassi. While Laver’s pure Grand Slam in 1969 is a phenomenal achievement that\\nhas yet to be matched, three of the four majors were on grass in those days, so only Agassi\\nhad won all four since they encompassed the four different surfaces they have today.\\nArriving in Paris for the 2012 French Open, Djokovic was not just going for the career set\\nbut also to be only the third man in history to hold all four major titles at the same time. He\\nsailed close to the wind with a five-sets win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the fourth round that\\nrequired him to save four match points, but he came through, and when he set up a final\\nagainst Nadal, it was the climax everyone wanted to see. Except, perhaps, the weather\\ngods, whose intervention heavily influenced the course of the match.\\nNadal won the first set and, as the drizzle started midway through the second set,\\nDjokovic earned a warning after dropping serve at 3–3 for hitting his courtside bench so\\nhard a bit of it splintered on to the court and had to be cleaned up by a ball-kid. With Nadal\\nleading by two sets and a break up early in the third, Djokovic seemed out of it but used his\\nseemingly hopeless position as a springboard to go for more risks. The tactic worked, and\\nthe Serb reeled off eight straight games. At 2–0 in the fourth set, a dramatic turnround was\\non the cards, but at that point the rain got \\nso heavy it was simply not possible to continue\\nand they came off for the night.\\nThe following day, Nadal broke Djokovic in the first game of the resumption, taking away\\nthe fourth-set advantage Djokovic still carried over from the night before. From then on\\nNadal was always ahead and Djokovic had to wait for five minutes while rain and thunder\\ngraced Roland Garros with Nadal just a game from victory at 5–4. Djokovic held for 5–5 but\\nconceded his next service game on a double fault, as Nadal claimed his seventh French\\nOpen title and broke the streak of three major finals in which he’d lost to Djokovic.\\nSo did the rain rob Djokovic on Sunday? It’s hard to make a convincing case that it did.\\nYes, the momentum was truly with him and the overnight break came at a good time for',\n",
       " 'Nadal. But the rain had helped Djokovic get back in the match early in the third set. By\\nmaking the balls heavier, it had blunted some of the merciless topspin that’s a feature of\\nNadal’s game and made it a more even contest. The ideal for Djokovic would have been\\nfor the drizzle to remain very light, or to be intermittent with some dry spells still under\\nheavy cloud – such weather is possible, but is it right to say that only such a very precise\\ncombination of conditions would have levelled the match? In addition, who’s to say Nadal\\nwould not have come back if the match had continued to a conclusion on Sunday?\\nAlthough the Spaniard is known for his phenomenal fitness, he is not just a physical player\\nbut a superb match player – he is remarkably immune to succumbing to his opponent’s\\nmomentum, frequently bouncing back when his opponent is having a purple patch. It’s\\nquite likely he would have done the same if the weather gods had allowed a Sunday finish.\\nDjokovic recognised as much when he spoke after Monday’s conclusion. He\\nacknowledged that the rain break had come at a bad time for him but also that the rain had\\nhelped him get back into the \\nmatch. And he recognised that Nadal was the better player\\nover the two days. He had put up a credible challenge, but no one could claim it was an\\nunfair result.\\n \\nThe full story of how Djokovic surrendered his Wimbledon title in the 2012 semi-finals to\\nRoger Federer has yet to be told. It’s possible there isn’t much of a story to tell – after all,\\nwhile Djokovic went into the match as a slight favourite, he had never beaten Federer on\\ngrass, and losing a four-setter to the great Roger Federer at his most successful\\ntournament is hardly a disgrace. And yet…\\nDjokovic said he had too many ups and downs and that a poor spell towards the end of\\nthe third set cost him a match that, until then, had been very even. It’s a plausible\\nexplanation. He also said he failed to make the most of his second shot of many rallies, in\\nparticular when he was serving. That prompted a question in his post-match press\\nconference: ‘Was there any particular reason why you didn’t feel as sharp as you were on\\nthat second ball? Did you feel good coming into today?’ Djokovic replied, ‘Not so great\\nreally. I had [a] bad last couple [of] days. Last five, six days I wasn’t feeling great. But I don’t\\nwant to talk about it now.’ Whatever the story was, he will tell it when he’s ready, but it was\\na strangely subdued Djokovic that day, and it would not be a shock to learn he had some\\nillness or minor injury. In some ways, it’s almost a relief to know that the guy whose body\\ncan carry him through two punishing five-setters in 48 hours the way it did in Australia six\\nmonths earlier can also rebel and deliver him only 80 per cent of his normal energy, even\\nin a tournament as big as Wimbledon. It makes this remarkable sporting specimen human.\\nHis final comment at Wimbledon was, ‘You know, life goes on. This is sport, I have to\\nmove on.’\\nBy the time he’d moved on to his next tournament, he should have been in cinemas\\nacross the entire world. Never one to shun the \\nlimelight, Djokovic had accepted a tiny\\ncameo role in a follow-up movie to the 2010 gangster hit \\nThe Expendables\\n. In\\nExpendables 2\\n, a remarkably plot-free film ‘written’ by Sylvester Stallone and starring\\nStallone, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger, Djokovic was filmed in a 10-second\\nappearance in which he single-handedly wipes out three (or is it four?) machine-gun-\\nwielding terrorists, all with his tennis racket. For a man who gave up the single-handed\\naggressive backhand when he was about seven, he takes out one of the terrorists with a\\nsuperb one-hander that Federer would have been proud of. A bit like the Indian tennis star\\nVijay Amritraj, who wielded his racket as a mean weapon in the 1983 James Bond film\\nOctopussy\\n, Djokovic looks like he’s having great fun. Yet the scene never made it to the',\n",
       " 'final version and his 10 seconds of heroism was left on the cutting-room floor, although it\\ndid make it on to YouTube. As long as it remains visible, he no doubt has scope for a corny\\npeace message along the lines that you don’t need guns, only tennis rackets.\\nA small detail from his appearance is that he was wearing his Sergio Tacchini zip-up\\ntop. That was part of the contract he signed in 2009 that saw him switch from Adidas, the\\nGerman clothing company whose sportswear he had worn since he was a junior, to the\\ncompany set up by a former Italian tennis player, Sergio Tacchini. His deal with Tacchini\\nwas nominally for five years, but after just half of it, Djokovic parted company with the\\nItalians in May 2012 to sign up with the Japanese clothing giant Uniqlo. Tacchini was\\nreported to be in financial difficulties and Djokovic would have been costing the firm a fair\\nbit; whether it was in difficulties or not, the split was amicable. The result was that, with\\nfilming having taken place in Bulgaria in 2011 when Djokovic was still under contract to\\nTacchini, the \\nExpendables\\n clip shows him wearing the Tacchini label several months after\\nswitching to the Japanese company Uniqlo.\\nThe switch to Uniqlo is interesting for what it says about the changing economics of\\ntenniswear. For several years, youngsters have tended to play tennis in cotton T-shirts and\\nonly used specific tennis shirts for matches (which is what the top players do). At the same\\ntime, tennis shirts have become appropriate clothing for casual and smart-casual social\\noccasions. In 2005 the French company Lacoste, set up by the legendary French player\\nfrom the 1920s, René Lacoste, signed up Andy Roddick because it specifically wanted to\\ntarget the US leisure market. While the world’s two market leaders in tenniswear, Nike and\\nAdidas, have concentrated on sports clothing, Djokovic was signed up by a Japanese\\ncompany looking to enhance its standing as a leisurewear retailer in high streets, shopping\\nmalls and on the Internet. At the same time as Djokovic was becoming Uniqlo’s global\\nbrand ambassador (players don’t just wear the clothing, they’re termed ‘brand\\nambassadors’ these days), another ‘high street’ brand, the Swedish chain Hennes &\\nMauritz (H&M), was signing up another top-10 tennis player, Tomas Berdych. It prompts\\nthe question of whether Next, Marks & Spencer or other familiar fashion names will soon\\nstart sponsoring tennis players.\\n \\nBy losing to Roger Federer at Wimbledon, Djokovic lost his No. 1 ranking. However, with\\nNadal off the tour after a mysterious second-round defeat at Wimbledon to Lukas Rosol,\\nthe Serb was still thought of as the man to beat. Yet he looked strangely off-colour when he\\nwent back to Wimbledon for the Olympics (then again, the All England Club was also off-\\ncolour, adorned as it was with bright Olympic-pink drapes incongruously set against the\\nVirginia creeper that grows around Centre Court). After losing his semi-final to Andy\\nMurray 7–5, 7–5, Djokovic seemed strangely unmotivated in the bronze-medal playoff\\nagainst Juan Martin del Potro. Perhaps he just wasn’t up for a second bronze medal after\\nthe \\none he won in Beijing in 2008, or maybe del Potro was fired up after coming so close to\\nbeating Federer in a four-hour semi-final. Whatever the reason, del Potro won 7–5, 6–4.\\nThe following week Djokovic won another Masters title but a somewhat diminished title,\\nas the Canada Masters in Toronto in 2012 didn’t feature all of the top players (many were\\nstill in London enjoying the Olympics). He reached the final in Cincinnati where Federer\\nbeat him in two sets, the first of them a 6–0 drubbing that lasted just 20 minutes and in\\nwhich Djokovic won a mere 10 points. But Djokovic looked all set to retain his US Open\\ntitle when he eased into the final having dropped just one set.\\nFacing him was Andy Murray, who had had a much tougher route to the final, as well as\\nall the pressure of seeking to become the first British man to win a major title since 1936. It',\n",
       " 'was a fluctuating match. Murray won the 87-minute first set on a 12–10 tie-break and led\\n5–1 in the second. Djokovic bounced back to 5–5 but lost the set 7–5. Djokovic then\\nplayed superb tennis in the third and fourth sets, picking up his level after being given a\\ntime violation, and as the players took bathroom breaks before the start of the fifth set,\\nDjokovic looked the likelier winner. But Murray bounced back to break twice at the start of\\nthe decider, and not even Djokovic calling for the trainer at 2–5 to have a groin strain\\nmassaged could knock Murray off course. There were those who wondered if it was a\\ntactical move, but whether it was or not, Murray was so in the zone that he barely seemed\\nto notice the delay before he served for the championship. And when Djokovic overhit a\\nforehand return of serve on championship point, the title was Murray’s.\\nGiven the closeness of the two in their progression through the junior ranks, it should be\\nno surprise that Djokovic and Murray should play out 50:50 contests when they face each\\nother at full tour level. But this was psychologically very important for Murray. \\nThey had\\nplayed each other a lot on the tour but it had taken Murray until their fifth match to win one.\\nAnd in their Grand Slam matches Djokovic always came out on top, so this win was\\nmassive for Murray. Djokovic was magnanimous in defeat at the end, respecting the\\nenormity of Murray’s first Grand Slam title, but there was no sense of him feeling he’d lost\\nto the better player the way there was in the French Open final. To Djokovic, this was\\nprobably one that got away.\\nBut then the tables were turned four months later when Djokovic beat Murray in the\\nAustralian Open final after seeming to be heading for defeat. Djokovic had come through\\nthe match of the tournament, if not of 2013, in beating Stanislas Wawrinka 12–10 in the fifth\\nset in five hours and two minutes. That was in the fourth round and he had a lapse in the\\nquarter-finals against Tomas Berdych that cost him a set. But by the time he reached the\\nfinal, he had recovered and was raring to take on his British rival. Murray had beaten\\nRoger Federer in the semi-finals in a match that was odd for being a five-set crushing. That\\nought not to be possible – a five-setter is by definition close, but Murray won all his sets\\ncomfortably while Federer won both of his on tie-breaks.\\nAfter Murray took the first set of the final, he had Djokovic on the ropes at 0–40 in the\\nsecond game of the second set. It looked to all those in the Rod Laver Arena as if Murray\\nwould triumph. But then two things happened. Firstly, Djokovic played three of his best\\npoints of the match to come back to deuce and ultimately save his serve. Secondly, in the\\nsecond set tie-break, a feather floated down from a passing bird as Murray prepared to\\ndeliver his second serve at 2–2. He stepped forward to remove it, went back to his baseline\\nand promptly double-faulted. Given that there had been no breaks of serve until that point,\\nit was a crucial lapse which Djokovic seized on. He won the tie-break to level the match,\\nafter which Murray \\nneeded renewed strapping to protect blisters on his foot. Djokovic broke\\nin the eighth game of the third set to emphasise the momentum shift and broke twice in the\\nfourth as he snuffed out Murray’s challenge.\\nIt made Djokovic the first man in the ‘open’ era of tennis to win three consecutive\\nAustralian Opens and emphasised that he was the world No. 1 for a reason. The question\\nwas now whether he could complete his set of majors.\\n \\nAt the end of January 2013 it was easy to see Djokovic and Murray as the new top two in\\nthe game. Federer was still around but showing signs of fading, while Nadal had been off\\nthe tour for seven months. There was much talk of his comeback, originally scheduled for\\nthe Australian Open but then delayed until the lower-ranking clay-court events in South\\nAmerica beginning the day after the Australian. But while many felt Nadal would still be a',\n",
       " 'factor on clay, few expected him to put up a sustained challenge on all surfaces. How\\nwrong they would prove to be.\\nNadal’s comeback was impressive. He reached the final in his first tournament in Chile,\\nwon the second and third in Brazil and Mexico, and then served notice that he was likely to\\nbe a factor by winning on the hard courts of Indian Wells, beating Federer, Berdych and del\\nPotro en route to the title. It meant the first meeting of the year between Djokovic and Nadal\\nwas eagerly awaited, especially as it came in the final in Monte Carlo, the clay-court\\ntournament where Nadal had never lost. The score of Djokovic’s 6–2, 7–6 win doesn’t\\nadequately illustrate just how dominant Djokovic was that day. In the first set he ate Nadal\\nfor breakfast, and while the Spaniard battled back in the second, Djokovic always seemed\\nto have the upper hand. With rumours circulating that Nadal’s knees were playing up\\nagain, the Monte Carlo final looked to be both psychologically and physically significant.\\nYet Djokovic had a poor run-in to the French Open, losing in the first round in Madrid to\\nthe maddeningly erratic Grigor Dimitrov, and in the Rome quarter-finals to Berdych.\\nMeanwhile Nadal won both titles, so went to Paris with real form.\\nBecause of the months he had spent off the tour, Nadal’s ranking had dropped and was\\nstill only back to four going into the French. It meant the top two players on form were not\\nguaranteed to be in separate halves of the draw, and indeed the names came out of the hat\\nin a top-heavy formation that left Djokovic and Nadal set to meet in the semi-finals, with\\nFederer and David Ferrer set for the bottom half. And so it came to pass that the most\\neagerly awaited match of the tennis year took place not in the final but the semis of the\\nFrench.\\nMidway through the second set, it looked a mismatch. Nadal had won the first set\\nconvincingly and Djokovic was fighting to keep in touch in the second. Nadal broke to lead\\n3–2 while Djokovic was hesitant and had slipped a couple of times on the increasingly dry\\nclay that was being baked by strong sun. But then Nadal played a poor game; Djokovic\\nseized his chance and broke twice to level the match. But Nadal regained the momentum\\nat the start of the third and had two set points for a 6–0 set before Djokovic finally won a\\ngame. In the fourth set, Nadal broke for 4–3, only to be broken straight back. He served for\\nthe match at 6–5 after another break but still Djokovic came back. The set went into the tie-\\nbreak, Djokovic was never behind and won it 7–3. That wave of confidence swept\\nDjokovic to a 4–1 lead in the decider with a double break. Nadal got one back and, at 4–3,\\nhe again put pressure on the Djokovic serve. That was when the incident happened that\\nthis match is remembered for.\\nDjokovic had recovered from 0–30 and then saved two break points. On the third deuce\\nhe opened up the court and had a simple putaway smash at the net. But in playing it, he\\nstumbled and touched \\nthe net before the ball had bounced a second time (or in this case,\\nlanded in the crowd). As it was right under the umpire’s chair and he had hit the ball well\\nwithin the umpire’s range of vision, Pascal Maria had a good view and called the point for\\nNadal. Djokovic argued with him for a couple of minutes but must have known deep down\\nthat, if the ball hadn’t bounced a second time before he touched the net, the umpire had no\\nchoice but to call the point for the Spaniard. Djokovic said afterwards he ‘should have won’\\nthe point and thought it might have gone to him as the ball had ‘left the dimensions of the\\ncourt’ before he touched the net. But he didn’t sound convincing; he could scarcely have\\nproved it had left the dimensions of the court, so he wisely stopped himself from saying it\\nwas an outright mistake.\\nDid that incident cost Djokovic the match? Looking at the flow of points, no. It cost him\\nthe point, which gave Nadal a third break point, but Djokovic saved it. So they were back at',\n",
       " 'deuce. It was then that Nadal won the next two points to level at 4–4 and was never behind\\nafter that. But in a finely balanced match, such incidents can change the momentum. One\\ncould also point to Djokovic complaining about the dryness of the court as he walked out to\\nserve at 7–8 – whether he was right or wrong, he lost the next four points, including one\\nhorrendous error on a smash, as Nadal ran out a 9–7 winner in four hours, 38 minutes.\\nThat fact was that, while Djokovic could well have won, Nadal’s victory was not unfair\\nbased on the course of the match. It was only Djokovic’s indefatigable refusal to accept he\\nwas beaten in the second and fourth sets that allowed him to be in a winning position in\\nthe fifth. And this is where Nadal is a match for Djokovic as a competitor – the Mallorcan\\nseldom seems to suffer for long from his opponent having the momentum; his ability to turn\\nthe tables is always a clear and present danger to the guy on the other side of the net. That\\nis why their matches are normally such brutal and bruising affairs and why this French\\nOpen semi-final was no different.\\nBy contrast, Nadal’s next match, the final against David Ferrer, was a walk in the park.\\nThis was the high watermark of Ferrer’s career. He had beaten Federer’s conqueror Jo-\\nWilfried Tsonga to reach his first (and so far only) Grand Slam final, a reward for unfailing,\\never courteous, low-profile striving to maximise his potential in the shadow of the great\\nNadal. But while Ferrer deserves to be regarded as the best of the rest, he was always a\\nclass below the big four in the matches that mattered, and Nadal made mincemeat of him\\nin a colourless final.\\nIf Djokovic-Nadal was the new (or revived) rivalry at the top of the game, it wasn’t a\\nconsistent one. In his next match after winning the French, Nadal was beaten by Steve\\nDarcis in the first round at Wimbledon. With Federer losing in the second round and other\\nbig names going out, Djokovic and Murray resumed their rivalry, which could not have\\ncontinued in Paris, as Murray missed Roland Garros due to a back injury that necessitated\\nsurgery later in the year. Following the carnage of the first three days, a Djokovic-Murray\\nfinal was on the cards from the evening of the first Wednesday. Ten days later it finally\\ncame round, despite Djokovic having had to go four and three quarter hours to beat Juan\\nMartin del Potro in the semi-finals in the best match of the tournament. The number seven\\nplayed a big part in the build-up to the final – it was 77 years since a Briton had last won\\nthe men’s singles at Wimbledon, Murray had beaten Djokovic seven times but never at\\nWimbledon and the match took place on seventh day of the seventh month.\\nBecause of the intensity of the build-up surrounding Murray, Djokovic was almost\\nrelegated to a bit-part player until the match finally began. And yet he seemed to be\\naffected by the hype and even by the heat, which was negligible by the standards of many\\ncities on the tennis tour but was sweltering by British standards. He was never sure\\nwhether to wear his cap or not and he was making \\nuncharacteristic errors. He lost his\\nserve twice in the first set and used up his three challenges too early in the second set, so\\nhe had nothing left on a questionable line call at 5–5. He ended up losing that set having\\nbeen 4–1 up and again let a 4–2 lead slip (after being 0–2 down) in the third set to leave\\nMurray serving for the title at 5–4.\\nAt that point he seemed to succumb to his oft-stated belief in destiny – perhaps\\nsomewhere deep down he believed it was Murray’s destiny to win Wimbledon, so he was\\njust going to make sure the home favourite had to win it, rather than get it handed on a\\nplate. If that was in his mind, he played some canny tennis with Murray on the point of\\nvictory. Djokovic saved three championship points and had three break points of his own\\nfor 5–5. There are many in the tennis world who believe that, if Murray had dropped serve\\nthen, the whole match would have turned, and subsequent admissions by Murray that his',\n",
       " 'arm was feeling very heavy with the pressure of the moment suggest that could easily have\\nhappened. But it’s one of those ‘what if’ moments of history that serve only to enliven a\\nconversation in the bar. The factual account records that Djokovic netted a backhand on\\nMurray’s fourth championship point, for Wimbledon to explode in the kind of ecstasy many\\nof the 15,000 crowd (and another 15,000 watching on Henman Hill) never dreamed they\\nwould witness.\\nDjokovic was sensitive and smart enough to recognise that this was a moment in which\\nhe was, by now, the invited guest at someone else’s wedding, and his on-court post-match\\ninterview was a model of diplomacy. ‘Congratultions to Andy, you absolutely deserved this\\nwin, you played incredible tennis. Congratulations to his team, I know how much it means\\nto them and how much it means to all you guys and to the whole country – so, well done!\\nI’m aware of the pressure he gets – there is a lot of expectation on him – and that makes\\nhis success even bigger. On my side, I gave it all, \\nit was an absolute pleasure and honour\\nagain to be part of this final. Thank you.’\\nFrom the brevity of his interview and the speed with which he came into his post-match\\npress conference and then disappeared, Djokovic just wanted to get out. A great champion\\nwho has given everything but still lost may have the awareness to recognise another\\nman’s big moment, but it’s not an environment in which many champions are comfortable\\nand he didn’t want to hang around.\\n \\nAnother thing great champions don’t like is being struck by a rival. At the Montreal Masters\\nfour weeks later, Nadal and Djokovic met in the semi-finals in a three-setter that Nadal won\\non a deciding tie-break. In the fifth game of the final set, Djokovic played a drop shot and\\nfollowed it into the net; Nadal played a backhand down the middle of the court, Djokovic\\nwas slow to see it coming and the ball struck him on the nose. Nadal instantly put his hand\\nup to apologise; Djokovic saw it but turned away without apparently acknowledging\\nNadal’s apology. The umpire tried to defuse the situation by announcing ‘Nadal has\\napologised’ as the crowd began to whistle. After the match, Nadal apologised verbally,\\neven though the play had been entirely legitimate. Djokovic declined to escalate the\\nincident and said it was ‘all fine’. A look at the match video suggests Djokovic was more\\nstunned than hurt (Nadal’s backhand was not particularly fiercely struck), but in his\\nmoment of intense competitiveness he wasn’t going to acknowledge the apology. It all\\nhappened so quickly that there was no time for premeditated action, but by the time they\\ncame off court, Djokovic was able to say the right thing for the issue to pass by as\\nuncontroversial.\\nThat night, Djokovic and a male friend from Serbia went out for a night on the town. They\\nwent to a Montreal night club, bought \\nseveral bottles of champagne and spent the time in\\nthe company of a number of young women who will have dined out on their good fortune\\never since. But once again, Djokovic had the ability to temper his own intake of alcohol\\nand remain a dignified reveller. He didn’t drink more than the odd glass and he was at all\\ntimes respectful to the women who fawned over him. He clearly enjoys himself but has\\nlimits he sticks to, both for himself and for those he socialises with.\\nAnd he knew he had to be in optimum condition for the next battle against Nadal, who\\nhad clearly bounced back after his shock first-round defeat at Wimbledon. They went to\\nNew York each having won one major in 2013 and, when they met in the final of the US\\nOpen, it clearly meant a lot to the Serb. At the end of the year he described his defeat to\\nNadal at the French as ‘my toughest loss’, but he seemed more emotionally devastated by\\nhis four-sets defeat to Nadal in the US Open final. It was effectively the match that allowed',\n",
       " 'Nadal to finish the year at the top of the rankings, although that might have happened even\\nif Djokovic had won at Flushing Meadows.\\nThe match followed a similar pattern to the Paris one. Nadal got off to the better start and\\ntook the first set. Djokovic broke back to take the second and have the better chances in\\nthe third, before Nadal reasserted himself to take a 2–1 lead. There the scripts departed\\nfrom each other, Djokovic failing to rally in the fourth as Nadal won in four. But the real\\ndamage was done in the second and third sets. Djokovic hadn’t broken the Spaniard until\\nthe sixth game of the second set but finally did so at the end of a 54-stroke rally. There had\\nbeen one of 54 strokes in the Djokovic-Murray final a year before but this one was more\\npunishing, both players delivering the kind of strokes that would have been clean winners\\nagainst most other players but having to see the ball come back with interest. To think Nike\\nbuilt a TV commercial around a 24-stroke \\nrally played by Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi\\nin the first set of the 1995 US Open final – that was club afternoon tennis compared with\\nthis!\\nYet, far from being the rally that changed the course of the match, it almost undid\\nDjokovic. He had finally broken serve but that rally had taken so much out of him that he\\nlost the subsequent service game to love as Nadal looked fresh as a daisy. The\\npsychological advantage Nadal took from that proved crucial as the match wore on.\\nDjokovic was able to get his break back and serve out the set, and when he led 2–0 at the\\nstart of the third, he had won six of the previous seven games. Nadal bounced back but\\nDjokovic had three break points at 4–4. Had he taken one of them, the outcome might have\\nbeen different (or might not), but Nadal saved all three, broke Djokovic in the next game to\\ntake the set, and then raced through the final set for the loss of just one game.\\nAgain Djokovic said the right thing at the end – ‘He was too good, he definitely deserved\\nto win this match and the trophy’ – but this time it was said with the energy of someone\\nwho was genuinely devastated to have lost a hard-court final to Nadal. He was to beat\\nNadal twice more before the end of the year; in fact, it was to be his last defeat of 2013. But\\nit seemed to hit him hard, however quickly he was able to bounce back from it.\\n \\nAfter leaving the Beogradska Arena with a torn back muscle on the final day of the 2011\\nDavis Cup semi-final, Djokovic announced he would sit out the 2012 Davis Cup year. For\\nan athlete for whom playing for one’s country is a massive part of the sport, this was a\\nslightly risky move, even if it made total sense in practical terms. But unlike Roger Federer,\\nwhose relegation of Davis Cup in 2005 to lower-priority status in his schedule led to a\\nlengthy downgrading of how he viewed the team competition, Djokovic promised he would\\nbe back in 2013 and was as good as his word.\\nHis loyalty to his country was sorely tested in the first round when Serbia was drawn\\naway to Belgium. Belgium may be an unfashionable country in tourism terms but it has\\nsome beautiful places. Unfortunately Charleroi isn’t one of them, yet the Belgian tennis\\nauthorities have a habit of choosing Charleroi for Davis and Fed Cup ties (it even played a\\nFed Cup final there at the height of Justine Henin’s and Kim Clijsters’ fame). So having just\\nbeaten Andy Murray in a four-set Australian Open final, Djokovic had to fly to Brussels to\\nbe on duty five days later against Olivier Rochus. At least it was only the world No. 127,\\nand Rochus’s best days were behind him, but it was still a major effort. Less well known is\\nthat the Serbian team had five hours to kill at one stage in the Charleroi trip, and Djokovic\\nled players and backroom officials in several hours of the game of charades, frequently\\nrevelling in the role of acting out the clues. One of the members of the Serbian team said it\\n‘showed he was a real leader, not just on court but in the way he dealt with everyone',\n",
       " 'involved’.\\nHis loyalty was tested still further in the quarter-finals, when he went from the Miami\\nMasters to the sleepy Mid-West town of Boise in Idaho to lead the Serbian team against\\nthe USA. After beating John Isner on the opening day, Serbia lost what was thought to be\\nthe vital second singles, when Sam Querrey beat Viktor Troicki in five sets. With the Bryan\\nbrothers expected to beat Serbia’s makeshift team of Nenad Zimonjic and Ilija Bozoljac, it\\nlooked set to go to a nervy fifth match. But the Serbian pair posted a remarkable win, 15–\\n13 in the final set, to leave Djokovic with the chance to put Serbia into the semis. In the\\nthird game of his reverse singles against Querrey, Djokovic twisted his ankle, fell to the\\nground and writhed in agony. He continued to grimace as the Serbian team trainer\\nstrapped the ankle, and he continued playing, gingerly at first but then with more\\nconviction. He was clearly worried about it and said afterwards, ‘If I wasn’t playing for\\nSerbia, I don’t know if I’d have gone all the way.’ Although Djokovic took the first set,\\nQuerrey took the second on the tie-break, which put wind into the sails of the Americans,\\nespecially as Djokovic’s ankle might have become more painful as the match wore on. But\\nfrom the start of the third set Djokovic played outstanding tennis and blew Querrey away.\\nHe dropped just one more game after that, and the ankle proved to be mildly bruised rather\\nthan a more serious injury.\\nSeptember’s semi-final allowed him to use the hero’s welcome he always gets in the\\nBeogradska Arena to help overcome the disappointment of defeat to Nadal in the US Open\\nfinal four days earlier. On a clay court laid to blunt the big serve of Canada’s Milos Raonic,\\nDjokovic found himself playing to keep Serbia in the tie after Zimonjic and Bozoljac had\\nplayed another marathon doubles, this time losing to Daniel Nestor and Vasek Pospisil.\\nBut his straight-sets win showed how much ground Raonic still had to make up against the\\nplayers at the very top, and he then cheered his team-mate Janko Tipsarevic as he beat\\nPospisil, the strains of Saturday’s doubles certainly giving the Canadian a much harder\\ntask than if he’d had a day off.\\nIn his on-court interview after beating Pospisil, Tipsarevic said, ‘Hopefully, we’ll have\\nViktor [Troicki] back for the final.’ Not only did Serbia not have Troicki for the final (see\\npages 250–1) but it didn’t have Tipsarevic either. At the tournament in Valencia in mid-\\nOctober, Tipsarevic picked up a heel injury that proved agonisingly slow to heal. He turned\\nup for the final, and even on the Wednesday night he was saying he hoped to be able to\\nplay. But he was playing in pain, and on Thursday morning he bowed to the inevitable and\\nwithdrew from the Davis Cup final. Djokovic clearly had a say in the decision to pick Dusan\\nLajovic as Tipsarevic’s replacement for the final against the Czech Republic, but the\\nbigger decision was whether Djokovic would play doubles. He had said throughout the\\nyear he was up for two singles but Serbia had to find the third point from somewhere else –\\nnow with both Tipsarevic and Troicki unavailable, would he step in for Saturday duty in the\\nhope of seeing Serbia through? The answer was no. He told his team-mates on the Friday\\nnight he would give everything in the singles but couldn’t add the doubles at the end of a\\npunishing year that had seen him finish with 23 matches unbeaten. He made it 24 by\\ntaking apart Tomas Berdych, leaving him with seven singles wins out of seven for the year\\nin Davis Cup and just one set dropped. But Lajovic, at 117 in the rankings, was no match\\nfor the wily Radek Stepanek, who was playing some of the best tennis of his career, and\\nthe Czechs retained their trophy with an anti-climactic win in the fifth match of the final\\nweekend.\\nWould Serbia have won if Djokovic had played doubles? It’s impossible to say with any\\nconviction. Berdych and Stepanek have a phenomenal record together and they played',\n",
       " 'with such confidence that they would have been hard to beat by any pair. But Bozoljac had\\na nightmare and Djokovic would certainly have got more returns in. At the end of the day\\nhe stuck to his deal, but when a team of – essentially – three singles players finds it’s down\\nto one, it’s very hard to win a Davis Cup final.\\nWith Tipsarevic still absent (though by now more though paternity leave than injury) and\\nTroicki still suspended, Djokovic decided not to play in the Davis Cup first round in\\nFebruary 2014. The decision was a late one, and who knows what went through his mind\\nwhen he found that Roger Federer was on the plane to Novi Sad to join his compatriot, the\\nnewly crowned Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka, in a full-strength Swiss\\nteam? Maybe Wawrinka’s win over Djokovic in Melbourne made Djokovic reluctant to face\\nhim so soon after such a painful defeat? Or maybe the presence of both Swiss meant\\nDjokovic couldn’t have helped Serbia to win unless he’d played on all three days. Either\\nway, it meant 2014 was not to be a Davis Cup year for Djokovic and the Serbs.\\n \\nIn the second half of 2013, Djokovic’s role as a statesman intensified markedly. In August\\nhe became one of the very few athletes to address the United Nations General Assembly.\\nThe UN had called a press conference to announce 6 April 2014 as the International Day\\nof Sport for Development and Peace. The announcement was made by Vuk Jeremic, the\\nSerbian foreign minister who was at the time president of the General Assembly and who\\nthe Djokovic family had installed as president of the Serbian Tennis Federation after the\\n‘coup’ they instigated in early 2011. Jeremic had asked Djokovic and the outgoing\\nInternational Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge to accompany him.\\nDjokovic addressed the assembly on behalf of the global sporting community. He said\\nhe hoped the international day would motivate people to do more to cultivate intrinsic\\nsporting values such as fair play, teamwork and respect for opponents. ‘These ideals are\\nuniversal,’ he said. ‘Every successful society is built on them and the more we instil\\nrespect for these ideals in ourselves, the better the world will be that we leave to our\\nsuccessors.’\\nAsked about the experience afterwards, he said,\\nI think the invitation was the coolest part. Just having this privilege of speaking in the\\nname of the global family of athletes on such a historical day. Historical because it’s in\\nthe United Nations and we all know how the United Nations is important as an\\norganisation. You have over 120 member states deciding about the biggest issues in\\nthe world. So there was definitely a special feeling that I didn’t experience before. You\\nhad this kind of sensation that you are part of something that is very big – just that\\nexperience, you know, brought me chills. Being in a position to speak was quite an\\nhonour. The president of the General Assembly is a Serbian, so to have two Serbian\\npeople speaking on such a historical day is even bigger for our country. It’s something\\nI will definitely never forget.\\nIf his speech was a safe, set-piece appearance, a few days later he ventured more of a\\ncontroversial opinion. After trouncing Joao Sousa in the third round of the US Open,\\nDjokovic was asked in his post-match press conference what he thought of the prospect of\\nair strikes against Syria. The Middle Eastern country was at the time in the midst of a brutal\\ncivil war, and evidence was emerging of the use of chemical weapons by the governing\\nregime against its own citizens, news that had prompted the US president Barack Obama\\nto seek a majority in Congress for intervention in Syria.\\nFew tennis players venture opinions on international political issues, but Djokovic',\n",
       " 'showed no reticence. ‘I’m totally against any kind of weapon, any kind of air strike or\\nmissile attack,’ he said. ‘I’m totally against anything that is destructive. Because I had this\\npersonal experience, I know it cannot bring any good to anybody.’ And in another answer\\nin the same conference, he said, ‘Those particular times that me and my fellow countrymen\\nand colleagues from Serbia have been through is definitely, you know, a period of life that\\nwe don’t wish anybody to experience. War is the worst thing in life for humanity. Nobody\\nreally wins.’ An interesting footnote is that he checked the transcript of his press\\nconference with the transcribers before he left the interview room, just to ensure they had\\ndown what he intended to say (if that sounds like censorship or rewriting the record, there\\nare occasional discrepancies between the typed record of a press conference and what\\nwas actually said).\\nAnd after the US Open when he was back in Serbia for the Davis \\nCup semi-final, he\\nappeared alongside the British former royal Sarah Ferguson at the opening of a primary\\nschool in central Serbia. The school in Kadina Luka had been renovated with funds from\\nthe Novak Djokovic Foundation. The school is entitled ‘Skolica Zivota’, which doesn’t\\ntranslate exactly but is probably best as ‘small school for life’ (see page 286).\\nAnd in the fortnight between the Davis Cup semi-final and the China Open in Beijing he\\ngot engaged to his girlfriend of eight years’ standing, Jelena Ristic. She had been taking\\non an increasingly large administrative role managing his international sponsorship and\\nPR work, not dissimilar to the role Mirka Vavrinec took on before she married Roger\\nFederer. The engagement certainly did nothing to harm his tennis, as he won his next 26\\nmatches.\\nHis friend Dusan Vemic says of Djokovic, ‘He’s very happy in the limelight.’ It’s not said\\nwith any inherent criticism, merely as a statement that Djokovic is a performer, so when the\\nChina Open asked him to recreate the infamous ‘Battle of the Sexes’ tennis match from\\n1973 by playing China’s top tennis icon Li Na in Beijing, he was happy to oblige, though\\nmore in a spirit of fun than fighting for gender equality. Throughout 2013 there had been\\nmany 40th anniversary tributes to the founding of the Women’s Tennis Association and\\nBillie Jean King’s victory over the chauvinistic American Bobby Riggs at the Houston\\nAstrodome in 1973. Li’s victory over Djokovic was somewhat more low-key – like King and\\nRiggs, they played a best-of-five match but it was best of five games, not sets, and\\nDjokovic began all five games 0-30 down. Li emulated King’s achievement by winning for\\nthe women by three games to two, after which they were treated to an enormous cake to\\ncelebrate the tournament’s 10th anniversary. It’s not known whether it was a gluten-free\\ncake. What is known is that Djokovic beat Nadal in the final a week later.\\nEven if Djokovic is very much a sporting statesman, it’s easy to \\nforget that, for all his\\nworldly wisdom, he’s still only midway through the third decade of his life. And sometimes\\na lack of experience in broader issues catches up with him. One such instance came at the\\nend of 2013, when he launched a scathing attack on tennis’s governing bodies in defence\\nof his friend and Davis Cup team-mate Viktor Troicki. Djokovic showed himself to be very\\neloquent, but at times his emotions got in the way of clear thinking.\\nTroicki had been suspended earlier in the year for 18 months for failing to provide a\\nblood sample at the Monte Carlo Masters in April. He claimed he had a life-long fear of\\nneedles, which was exacerbated when he was unwell. As he said he was unwell in Monte\\nCarlo and said he had suffered the effects of strong sun, he asked the Doping Control\\nOfficer responsible for his blood and urine tests whether he could forego his blood test, as\\nhe feared he would faint. He claims she said yes but changed her story later. She said she\\nnever gave him any such assurance and warned him he could face sanctions if he didn’t',\n",
       " 'do his blood test that day. On examining the case, tennis’s anti-doping authorities said\\nmissing a test was a serious breach of the regulations, and they banned him for just six\\nmonths less than if he had taken the blood test and been found positive for a banned\\nsubstance. Troicki appealed to the Court for Arbitration in Sport (CAS), which delivered its\\nruling during the ATP World Tour Finals in London.\\nThe CAS judged that Troicki was at fault, but found that the Doping Control Officer in\\nMonte Carlo could have sought the assistance of an ATP official to help persuade Troicki\\nto provide the sample. It therefore concluded the sentence was a little too harsh and\\nreduced it from 18 months to 12. But that was of little consolation to Djokovic. Not only was\\nhis friend deprived of a full year of his professional career but Serbia was deprived of one\\nof its Davis Cup players for the following week’s final at home to the \\nCzech Republic. The\\nSerbs could have won without Troicki as long as Janko Tipsarevic was fit, but Djokovic\\nknew Tipsarevic was in a race against time to recover from his heel injury and was in\\nserious danger of missing the final. Troicki’s ban was therefore a serious setback for\\nSerbia.\\nThe CAS judgement was delivered on the day Djokovic played Roger Federer in\\nLondon, and the former’s post-match press conference was rife with anticipation about how\\nhe would respond to the confirmation of Troicki’s ban. Normally in post-match press\\nconferences, the player walks in, sits down, takes questions and walks out at the end. This\\none was different. After the usual questions about Djokovic’s victory against Federer, he\\nwas asked whether he had any comments to make about the judgement. Djokovic reached\\nfor his pocket, took out some notes and proceeded to speak for seven minutes\\nuninterrupted. It was highly impressive, but the eloquence gradually gave way to emotion\\nand he left himself open to attack on several fronts.\\nDjokovic outlined his grievance as follows:\\nIt’s very bad news that we got for him [Troicki], and for me, for all of us who are close to\\nhim. But I think it’s just not bad news for him, it proves again that this system of Wada\\n[World Anti-Doping Agency] does not work. Why am I saying that? Because, first of all,\\nas a tennis pro, our job is to play tennis and respect all the rules and know all the rules\\nof our sport. But when you are randomly selected to go and provide the test – blood\\ntest or urine test – the representatives of Wada who are there at the tournament are\\nsupposed to give you the clear indications and explain [to] you the rules and\\nregulations and what the severe consequences or penalties [are] that you might\\nundertake or you might have if you fail to provide the test. The representative didn’t do\\nthat in his case. So first, he’s not positive on any banned substance. I’m not saying\\nthat it’s completely not his fault, but … she did not clearly present him [with] all the\\nsevere consequences that he will have if he avoids that. She told him that he needs to\\nwrite a report and that he will be just fine. And because of her negligence and\\nbecause of her unprofessionalism, he is now off the tour for one year. And now it\\nmakes me nervous as a player to do any kind of test.\\nDjokovic was effectively seizing on one element of the judgement to make it sound as if the\\nwhole process was a lottery. The CAS’s judgement did indeed say that the Doping Control\\nOfficer might have misled Troicki by suggesting he write to the ITF setting out his reason\\nfor not wanting to take the blood test – the CAS said this ‘led him erroneously to believe\\nthat she was confident that the outcome would be positive’ – and that she failed in her duty\\nto ‘always ensure that there is no possible misunderstanding involved’ and that she should\\n‘always encourage the athlete to proceed with the doping control’ by making him',\n",
       " 'understand ‘perhaps with some persuasion […] the importance of following the\\nprocedures’. But it also said there was no objective justification for Troicki failing to provide\\na blood test and added that Troicki’s memory was ‘coloured by his subsequent\\nreconstruction of events’. So Djokovic was judging the whole case on Troicki’s version of\\nhis conversation with the Doping Control Officer, a version that had been thrown into doubt\\nby the judicial body looking at every detail of the case. Accusing a professional of\\n‘negligence’ and ‘unprofessionalism’ on that evidence is skating on thin ice.\\nHe also said Troicki’s decision to take a blood test the following day – a test that was\\nfound to be clear – showed that Troicki had not committed any offence. But that doesn’t\\nhold water, as there is the potential for substances to show up in a blood test one day that\\nwould not show up the next day, so giving the blood sample at the time it’s requested is a\\ncrucial part of the integrity of the anti-doping process.\\nDjokovic was honest enough to admit that Troicki was ‘a very good friend of mine’,\\nsomeone he had known since the age of eight, and that this meant he was ‘emotionally\\nconnected’ to the case. Perhaps for that reason the tennis world appeared happy to accept\\nthat Djokovic had gone into bat for a friend, and that, if his defence of Troicki was\\npassionate to the point of not being rock-solid, well, that’s what sometimes happens when\\nyou see your first loyalty as being to your friend and team-mate. But he was probably more\\nthan a little shocked when, later the same week, both Roger Federer and Andy Murray\\ntotally rejected Troicki’s defence – Federer said that, when a player is asked for a sample,\\nhe or she has to give it, and Murray said Troicki had been ‘unprofessional’ not to undergo\\nthe blood test and while he had some sympathy for the player’s position he had no\\nsympathy for his argument.\\nNo one should have too much of a dig at Djokovic for taking one element of the CAS’s\\njudgement and trying to maximise its impact. That is the staple of politicians and lawyers\\nfighting their corner in the face of inconvenient evidence to the contrary. But he has to be\\ncareful about fighting for a friend so hard that he risks undermining the credibility of tennis’s\\nanti-doping measures. He himself is a man who has taken fitness, endurance and recovery\\nat the top of the game to new levels, but he will only receive credit and respect for that if his\\nsport is seen to be clean. He will be aware of athletes, cyclists and performers from other\\nsports whose achievements have never quite received the recognition they deserve\\nbecause of the drug-induced exploits of their predecessors, so as one of the leading\\nproponents of tennis Djokovic has a duty to make sure the image of a clean sport is not\\nundermined.\\nWhere the emotions really took over was in his subsequent attack \\non the ATP. He said,\\n‘The ATP, who is supposed to be an association of players, of tennis professionals, who is\\nsupposed to be the governing body, the association that stands behind the players, is not\\ngoing to answer on this announcement, is not going to do anything for Viktor.’ He went on,\\n‘The system [in the ATP’s governance] is so complicated, and it’s not working for players\\nbecause the ATP is 50 per cent players, 50 per cent tournaments. So every time you want\\nto vote for something, you need a majority, which is impossible because you’re going\\nagainst tournaments. Players have no energy or time to spend on these things. We don’t\\nhave time for politics. The structure right now doesn’t go in favour of players.’\\nThis is seriously flawed argumentation on many fronts. For a start, it seems to assume\\nthe players are more important than the tournaments – true, the tournaments can’t function\\nwithout players, but then players can’t function without tournaments, so the two have to\\nwork together. Secondly, if he says he has no time for politics, he has to trust those who do\\n– that is a law of life, not just of tennis. Oddly, he has been involved in tennis politics. He is',\n",
       " 'a former member of the ATP Player Council and is very close to Ivan Ljubicic, a former\\npresident of the council who tried to tackle the alphabet soup of tennis’s governing bodies.\\nIt means that any attack on the ATP is an attack on himself as a member of the ATP. And it\\nwas a little tacky to issue a stinging attack on the ATP at the ATP’s flagship tournament of\\nthe year – it’s not quite like insulting the host who has invited you to dinner, but he might\\nhave chosen another moment, especially as his beef was with the Doping Control Officer\\nand the Court for Arbitration in Sport, not primarily with any of tennis’s governing bodies.\\nDespite the holes that can be shot through his argument, Djokovic came away from his\\noutburst on behalf of Troicki with his reputation for eloquence enhanced. He had made the\\npoint very \\nclearly that, whatever the rights and wrongs of tennis’s anti-doping regime, he\\nand other players felt vulnerable to being caught out by the system while trying to play\\nstrictly by its rules. And he had made the point that if a player doesn’t play strictly by the\\nrules he (or she) can lose a year of their career, whereas when a Doping Control Officer\\ndoesn’t play strictly by the rules there appears to be no sanction against them. There were\\nmany who felt this was a tennis administrator of the future in the making. At the time he\\nmade his comments, the ATP had still not replaced the late Brad Drewett as its chairman\\nand chief executive, which heightened the sense that Djokovic might one day be\\nappropriate for the role. At 26, he could be forgiven for being politically wet behind the\\nears, or for putting the interests of a childhood friend ahead of a coherent argument. In the\\nlong term, however, a greater appreciation for the complexities of governance will be\\nneeded.\\nInterestingly, he didn’t mention the International Tennis Federation in his monologue\\nabout Troicki, despite being known to harbour resentments about certain decisions taken\\nby the ITF. Perhaps this was a bit of \\nRealpolitik,\\n based on the fact that the ITF owns and\\nruns the Davis Cup and the following week he was to be the star act in the Davis Cup final\\nin his home city of Belgrade. Ultimately, Serbia lost a strange final in which all five matches\\nwere decided in straight sets and Serbia’s inability to parade Troicki and Tipsarevic cost\\nthe hosts dear. At the trophy-presentation ceremony, Djokovic shook the hand of the ITF\\npresident Francesco Ricci Bitti and smiled at him, but he and Tipsarevic were the only\\nmembers of the Serbian team not to show up at the official Davis Cup dinner later that\\nnight. It would be too strong to say they boycotted the dinner, but it was certainly a silent\\nprotest.\\n \\nHealth problems in the family of Marian Vajda caused a rethink in the Djokovic team in the\\nlatter part of 2013. Vajda made it clear he \\ndidn’t want to be on the road as much, so he and\\nDjokovic discussed who might come in as a new principal coach, albeit with Vajda still\\nheavily involved. The choice they made took the tennis world by surprise: Boris Becker.\\nBecker had spent most of his time since retiring in the late 1990s as a television pundit.\\nThe complexities of his private life, which included fathering a child from a one-night stand\\nin the broom cupboard of a London restaurant, had made him into a celebrity figure of\\nconstant discussion and speculation but hardly one of the world’s movers and shakers. A\\nman of great charm and immense charisma, he attracted attention wherever he went,\\nespecially in his native Germany where he is something of a deity, but also in Great Britain,\\npartly because he had a home in Wimbledon. But his comments on tennis were not widely\\nviewed as profound, and a feature of many of his pronouncements was the constant\\npresence of his ego. As he had never coached a touring professional before, the tennis\\nworld wondered what Becker would be able to say to Djokovic.\\nThe official line from Djokovic was that Becker would be helping with the mental aspect',\n",
       " 'of Djokovic’s game, specifically how to handle the big points in the big matches. In some\\nways, this made sense – Djokovic had lost a number of big matches he arguably should\\nhave won, such as the 2012 French Open final, the 2012 Wimbledon semi-final, the 2013\\nFrench semi, the 2013 Wimbledon final and the 2012 and 2013 US Open finals. Becker is\\none of the few people who knows how to turn a match round that is slipping away and how\\nto win the big titles. But can he impart this knowledge? That was the unknown quantity and\\nwas still unknown as this book went to press.\\nIt was easy to make fun of the arrangement when it was announced. Becker had had an\\nawful 2013, with various personal problems and ballooning weight following an ankle\\nproblem that required surgery. And with Andy Murray having hired Ivan Lendl \\nin 2012 and\\nRoger Federer hiring Stefan Edberg, Marin Cilic hiring Goran Ivanisevic and Kei Nishikori\\nhiring Michael Chang, all in late 2013, it seemed like a draft of the big names of the 1980s\\nand 1990s that Djokovic didn’t want to miss out on.\\nTheir first outing together didn’t bode well. Djokovic lost his Australian Open winning\\nstreak in the quarter-finals, his 25-match unbeaten run at Melbourne Park ending with a 9–\\n7 final-set defeat to Stanislas Wawrinka. The defeat looked a little better five days later\\nwhen Wawrinka lifted the trophy – his first Grand Slam title was assisted by a back injury to\\nRafael Nadal in the final, but Wawrinka was playing well enough to have won the trophy\\neven without the help of Nadal’s back. And by the end of the fortnight in Melbourne, the\\nrelationship seemed to have sent out the message that it was serious and not some kind of\\npublicity stunt.\\nSo why did Djokovic hire Becker? The reason given has some credibility, although\\nmuch will depend on whether Becker can pass on his experience and on-court presence to\\nsomeone else. Djokovic greeted Becker with a request to speak German with him so he\\ncould freshen up his command of the language; with Djokovic living for much of the year in\\nMonaco where he speaks French (he has a dog called Pierre, so one assumes he speaks\\nFrench to the dog), and speaking Italian with his manager Edoardo Artaldi, it’s easy to joke\\nthat he picks his team on the basis of which languages he can add to his collection. But\\nthere may be two deeper-lying reasons for his choice of Becker.\\nWhat was clear in Melbourne at their first tournament together was that the appointment\\nof Becker had created a buzz around Djokovic that wasn’t there before. His practice\\nsessions were suddenly sought-after events, even though Becker was doing little more\\nthan feeding tennis balls to a hitting partner because he was still recovering from his ankle\\nsurgery (he had lost a few kilos and had worked out a training programme, so the German\\nwas clearly \\ntaking the arrangement seriously and benefiting from it personally). Questions\\nabounded in Djokovic’s press conferences about Becker and he even acceded to a\\nrequest from Jim Courier in an on-court interview to perform his impersonation of Becker\\nafter a victory on the Rod Laver Arena – the rocking service motion performed under\\nBecker’s eyes brought the house down. If the leading three figures in world tennis all need\\nan image to sustain their profile, Federer is the stylish traditionalist, Nadal the physical bull,\\nwhile Djokovic is something of the amiable professor. But Djokovic’s image doesn’t\\ntranslate as easily as the other two, and the world doesn’t always get his blend of the\\nheart-pumping warrior and the Tolstoyesque philosopher. Having Becker in his camp\\ncertainly gave him a popular standing that he didn’t have with Vajda.\\nWhether that is enough reason on its own to hire the German is doubtful, but the Serbian\\ntennis journalist Vojin Velickovic offers another possible reason. ‘People think Igor\\nCetojevic gave Novak only the gluten-free diet,’ he says, ‘but I talked to him and he\\nbelieved he gave Novak two things: the diet and a form of conversation that is very',\n",
       " 'important to Novak. He likes to work things out, to think them through, and I think Cetojevic\\nwas able to have conversations with him that gave him a very clear mind going into\\nmatches. Maybe he has missed that and the relationship with Boris is a chance to have\\nthese conversations and prepare his mindset before matches?’\\nBecker may also be able to help with things like tournament planning. At the end of a\\npunishing 2013, Djokovic played several exhibition matches in South America with Nadal\\nand then played no official warm-up tournaments for the Australian Open. Much as it would\\nhave helped his bank balance and his profile in Latin America, it may have left him short of\\nmatch practice for the Grand Slam at which he has been most successful. Becker is likely\\nto be stricter on tournament planning at the end of 2014. It’s clear the \\nfuture of the Djokovic-\\nBecker partnership hangs on several factors,\\nincluding perhaps Vajda’s willingness to travel if his family situation\\nbecomes more conducive.',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER THIRTEEN\\nA ‘GIVING’ PERSON\\nI\\nn October 2013 Serbia’s national airline JAT (Yugoslav Air Transport) signed a deal with\\nthe Abu Dhabi airline Etihad for Etihad to buy a 49 per cent stake in JAT and run the\\nSerbian carrier. Part of the deal was that JAT would be rebranded as Air Serbia. It included\\na new logo to grace all the tail fins, a variation of the Serbian double-headed eagle. That\\nsymbol from Serbian heraldry had become associated with Serbia’s reputation as an\\naggressor in the 1990s wars, so the fact that it was the basis of the new Air Serbia logo\\nshowed perhaps that the Serbs were becoming less coy about using some traditional\\nsymbols from their country’s cultural heritage.\\nAnother part of the deal was that 14 planes would be named after iconic Serbian figures.\\nAnd it should surprise no one that the first plane was named Novak Djokovic. The simple\\nfact is that Djokovic is Serbia’s best ambassador by a country mile, and the nation’s\\nleading lights are falling over themselves to make the most of him while he’s around.\\nBoris Tadic was Serbia’s president from 2004 to 12. He was frequently courtside when\\nDjokovic and Serbia’s other top players played for the biggest titles and for their country in\\nthe Davis and Fed Cups. ‘Serbians feel very proud because of Novak,’ Tadic said after\\nDjokovic’s Wimbledon triumph in 2011. ‘The people have been suffering very much in the\\nlast few decades and that kind of victory is very helpful, it makes people very proud. For\\nsure, he’s helping to change Serbia’s reputation. The first association people have of\\nSerbia is Novak Djokovic, not the Serbian president, and that’s very good. We had a first\\nassociation with Serbia through the former president [Slobodan Milosevic] and that was\\nvery bad. Now the situation is totally different and I’m very proud about Novak.’\\nDragan Djilas, the leader of Serbia’s Democratic Party and mayor of Belgrade until\\nOctober 2013, told a group of international journalists, ‘I think it would be very useful if one\\nday the world’s media would start to speak about Serbia not in terms of the wars, not about\\nMilosevic – I know this is interesting and every few months it comes up – but it’s important\\nthey speak of Serbia through someone like Novak Djokovic or some other successful guys\\nfrom Serbia, scientists, professors, young people, people from culture. Djokovic is great –\\nwe need more like him to promote a different image of Serbia.’\\nWhat’s interesting is that Djilas was clearly trying to find a list of Serbian role models but\\ncould think only of Djokovic. For the record, the second person to have a plane named\\nafter them in the Air Serbia fleet was Emir Kusturica, the film director, who is playing a\\nsimilar role to Djokovic in the arts world.\\nThe need for an ambassador may seem a little strange to citizens of countries like the\\nUSA or Great Britain; nations which are largely blissfully unaware of the way some parts of\\nthe world view them with contempt. The Serbs are in no doubt that their international\\nreputation needs some repair. Two of Serbia’s top tennis players of \\nthe pre-Djokovic era,\\nNenad Zimonjic and Dusan Vemic, had to make their way on the circuit during and\\nimmediately after the wars of the 1990s, with sanctions and visa restrictions widespread.\\n‘There were stories going round in the nineties when they blamed us for things we didn’t\\ndo,’ says Zimonjic. ‘There was often proof that we weren’t to blame, but no one talks about\\nthat and the bad reputation hangs on. So it’s nice when we have someone who can\\npresent a positive image. Hopefully, what Novak is doing will give a chance for the world to',\n",
       " 'look at us objectively and maybe can create the conditions for upcoming generations to\\nquestion some of the things that were misrepresented.’\\nVemic says the problem with Serbia’s reputation went further than just the Yugoslav\\nwars. ‘We were always represented in the late 1990s and early 2000s as criminals and\\nterrorists, not just in the news but in many movies,’ he says. ‘We were always the bad\\nguys. I’m sure he’s helped change that, at least a little bit. He’s given us some recognition\\nin the world in a positive light. He has always represented our country in a really positive\\nand proud way. For the country, he was the best ambassador.’ Vemic is not the only Serb\\nto note that the Serbian terrorist or criminal is a stereotype among film directors, and it\\nthrows an interesting light on Djokovic’s cameo performance for \\nExpendables\\n \\n2\\n as a\\nracket-wielding killer, even if the sequence ended up on the cutting-room floor. It’s worth\\nnoting that there has been a Hollywood convention for many years that when a villain is\\nneeded an English accent is normally used, yet by and large the English don’t seem to\\nnotice.\\nIt’s possible therefore to make the case that the Serbs have an inferiority complex, but\\neven if they do it’s still real, especially to those who travel abroad and have to deal with the\\nworld’s reaction to the name of the country. When an American, a Briton, a Frenchman, a\\nGerman, an Australian, or indeed a citizen of any one of the four dozen most prominent\\ncountries of the world says where \\nthey come from, there is normally instant recognition of\\nthe country. But until recently, a Serb travelling abroad would encounter either hostility or\\npuzzlement. It’s something Djokovic himself was very aware of when he started travelling.\\n‘Not many people knew where Serbia is,’ he says, ‘and some of them even thought I was\\nsaying Siberia. It was an adventure explaining to them where Serbia is, but I enjoyed it. I\\nfelt that I was on a mission to bring as much good as I can to stand next to my country’s\\nname, because the media wasn’t bringing out the best news about my country at that time.’\\nThe Serbian television commentator Nebojsa Viskovic tells the story of the first Grand\\nSlam tournament he covered. ‘It was the 2001 US Open, just before 9/11,’ he says. ‘When I\\nsaid where I came from, people would say, “Where?” I would whisper it. Since the tennis\\neuphoria it’s such a different story. When I do interviews, people from other television\\nstations sometimes ask me where I come from, and when I say “Serbia” they give me the\\nthumbs-up. Because something nice happened, something nice came from Serbia – not\\nonly Novak but the women as well, Ana and Jelena. Now I say I’m from Serbia with pride.’\\nAna Ivanovic herself says, ‘Many times I’ve been asked, “Oh, is it safe to go to Serbia?”\\nWhen you meet people at tournaments around the world and people ask where you’re from\\nand you say Serbia, they often ask, “Is it safe there?” and I say, “Yes, it’s very safe there.”\\nAt the movies all the gangsters and criminals, all the bad guys, are either Serbians or\\nRussians, so it’s not really fair. I really hope people can have a better image of Serbia.’\\nThis illustrates the importance to Serbia of having an international role model, and\\nindeed some people interviewed for this book say they now find the instinctive reaction to\\nthe word ‘Serbia’ is, ‘Ah, Novak Djokovic.’\\nResponding to all the big names who say he is the best \\nambassador Serbia could have,\\nDjokovic says, ‘That’s a lot of responsibility. I feel the pressure. It’s because we have a\\nharder way to succeed in life, we Serbs, because of the past we’ve had, because of the\\nhistory. We have to dig deeper and we have to do much more in order to be seen and to be\\nspotted.’\\nNot that Djokovic has any difficulty being spotted; in fact, he seems to be a born\\nperformer. He has been invited on to many of the big US television shows and has been\\nhappy to oblige with all sorts of publicity stunts that many players would have run away',\n",
       " 'from. He sang a song at the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest which was hosted by Serbia in\\nBelgrade. Asked to take part in a fashion show in Montreal in 2009, he ripped off a silk\\nbathrobe to reveal the briefest pair of briefs. And at the end of 2010 he allowed himself to\\nbe strapped to the wing of a bi-plane, wing-walking and volleying tennis balls in a\\ncommercial for his racket company Head (‘My mother asked me, “Why did you do that?” – it\\nwas crazy, one of the craziest things I’ve done in my life for sure.’). But there’s a valuable\\ndividend for his country in his showmanship. Writing in August 2011 about Djokovic’s\\nappearance on Jay Leno’s talk show \\nTonight\\n, the Serbian-American writer Ana Mitric said,\\n‘Before Djokovic, the three most “famous” Serbs were dictator Slobodan Milosevic and\\nmilitary “leaders” Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic [all three of whom have ended up in\\nthe UN’s war-crimes tribunal in The Hague] – not exactly the type of guys who get invited\\non to the \\nTonight\\n show.’\\nAlthough he’s streets ahead of anyone else in Serbia in terms of his international profile,\\nDjokovic is not alone. Four months after his first Grand Slam title at the 2008 Australian\\nOpen, Ana Ivanovic won the French Open title and made it to the top of the world rankings,\\nso she and Jelena Jankovic were also ambassadors for their country. Ivanovic says,\\nIt was one of the great honours we had as sports people to represent Serbia. I think\\nsport brings people together and no one judges where you come from; they judge\\nwhat you achieve. In a way I, and I think everyone else, felt like it was a chance to\\nbring a better name to our country. The few times we had a chance to meet our\\npresident [Boris Tadic], he always showed appreciation and gratitude for that. He used\\nto say, ‘You guys are the best ambassadors we can have.’ What Novak is doing now\\nis amazing and it helps our country so much. He’s told me it was a great honour and\\nthe chance to show a different face, and to show that we have funny people.\\nIt’s not just that Djokovic is a good role model – how he goes about his nationality is part of\\nwhat the world finds appealing. He is patriotic and never misses a chance to promote\\nSerbia but there’s nothing messianic about it. Given that his mother is Croatian, it should\\nbe no surprise that some of his best friends are Croats (in particular, Ivan Ljubicic and\\nMarin Cilic), but given how Serbia and Croatia fought each other in the early 1990s, it’s a\\nfact that’s not without significance. And there was the trophy presentation in Montreal in\\n2007 when Djokovic was introduced by the master of ceremonies as being from Croatia.\\nHe laughed it off, saying, ‘I don’t mind you calling me Croat. Serbs and Croats, it’s almost\\nthe same. We’re all people.’ In an interview with a Croatian newspaper, Djokovic said, ‘I\\nwould put myself above all the nationalist \\nconferva\\n. For someone abroad, it is very difficult\\nto distinguish between our people, our borders, who we are, what we are. That is why I am\\nnot offended. I know how much effort I need to explain where I come from and where these\\nmountainous Balkans are.’\\nAlthough Djokovic would always have been an internationalist in some way, he has\\nperhaps been helped more than is obvious by his friendship with Ivan Ljubicic. A Croatian\\nborn in Bosnia of mixed \\nBosniak-Catholic parentage, Ljubicic could have had one of at\\nleast three nationalities but ended up a national hero for Croatia. ‘I feel part of the world,’\\nhe says. ‘I was never nationalistic – people mix up nationalism with patriotism, which are\\ntwo different things. I love playing for the country and support the country but it doesn’t\\nmean I hate others. I respect everybody. Once you circle the world with other people, you\\ncan’t just enclose yourself with such a small environment.’\\nLjubicic wonders whether Djokovic’s strong Serbian consciousness has detracted from\\nhim being a truly global star. ‘I think he did a tremendous job – I’m not sure how much',\n",
       " 'people in Serbia are giving him credit for this, but Serbia really had a negative reputation in\\nthe past and I know he’s done a lot and he’s trying hard. Maybe some people don’t see him\\nas a global star because he’s really proud of being a Serbian and he’s putting Serbia at the\\nfront all the time. He’s trying to promote the country harder than anyone else before him,\\nprobably because he feels the reputation the country has is not right and he wants to\\nchange that.’\\nThe American Todd Martin, who was a member of Djokovic’s coaching team in 2009–\\n10, tells an interesting story about Djokovic the diplomat:\\nNovak has a pretty good understanding certainly of his own country’s history and\\nsome of the relationship stuff with other countries. He’s also a bit of a people person,\\nso he hasn’t wasted this opportunity of travelling the world and experiencing different\\ncultures, and he’s generally pretty aware. That meant there were times when I was the\\none American with lots of people from the Balkan or Slavic regions. One time in\\nparticular it was pretty difficult to be that guy without a great knowledge of Serbia –\\nSerbian-American relations were never a huge part of my course of study, whereas\\nAmerica is the big fish for the Serbians and for a lot of other countries. One fellow we\\nencountered – I forget whether he was Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian or what – thought\\nthe American government was to blame for some of the issues his country had\\nexperienced over the years. He may be right, I needed some better understanding of\\nthe background which I didn’t have, so I did my best to play dumb, which isn’t really\\ntoo difficult for me. But this guy was particularly aggressive with his opinion, and I felt\\nNovak did a tremendous job of explaining the perspective without necessarily taking a\\nside and without upsetting his friend, so it wasn’t confrontational. I was impressed.\\nGiven the battering Serbia’s reputation in the world took in the 1990s, the question arises\\nas to whether Djokovic could in some way atone for his country’s atrocities. A straw poll of\\na number of Serbs illicits a near universal answer: ‘That would be treachery’, ‘He’d be a\\ntraitor to his country’ and such like. These responses highlight the dual role Djokovic plays\\nas a Serb and an international citizen. As an international citizen, he recognises the need\\nfor reconciliation and the part that the acknowledgement of transgressions against human\\ndecency plays in that reconciliation, yet as a Serb he has to be loyal to his country. This is\\nwhy he sometimes seems more of a warrior when playing in Serbia and more of an athlete\\nwhen playing in the world’s greatest tennis stadiums. And why he has to tread carefully at\\ntimes. For example, as a noted supporter of the Red Star Belgrade football team, he’s\\nsometimes asked to put on the team shirt for publicity photos, but Red Star is currently\\nsponsored by the controversial Russian energy giant Gazprom, and Djokovic will be aware\\nof Gazprom’s dubious reputation in the west so doesn’t overdo the occasions when he\\nwears the shirt.\\nThe thoughtful Serbian sports journalist Zoran Milosavljevic \\nobserves, ‘What drives him\\nis his patriotism and desire to represent Serbia in the best possible way. There’s a lot of\\ndefiance in it. His driving force is to show that Serbia is not an aggressive backwater but a\\nmodern, civilised country. He does this by his good manners, language skills and general\\nsense of humour.’\\nAmid all the talk about him representing Serbia abroad, it’s important not to overlook his\\nability to help heal the still latent divisions within the states of the former Yugoslavia. His\\nmix of being a Serb born to a Croatian mother and an ethnic Montinegrin father from\\nKosovo is not dissimilar to the mixed parentage of Tito, and while there are plenty of\\npeople in the former Yugoslav lands who have mixed ethnic heritage, the importance of',\n",
       " 'such mixed parentage in a high-profile hero could be significant. Dejan Petrovic says of\\nDjokovic’s standing in Serbia, ‘Nole can be like Tito, doing the job of uniting people,\\ndefinitely within Serbia if not for other countries that were formerly Yugoslavia.’\\nDjokovic himself says, ‘I actually love all the ex-Yugoslav countries, and that includes\\nCroatia too, regardless of the horrible war. I am not a person who holds a grudge over\\nsomething for too long, I have a forgiving nature. Maybe it’s because I haven’t experienced\\nthe worst from the war, because I didn’t lose my family or my home, like other people who\\nhave a much harder time forgiving and forgetting. But I honestly don’t think that we as\\ncountries have any more reasons to fight. The media tend to stir the pot way too often. The\\nmoment we start forgetting, they keep reminding us and pulling us back into the past,\\nwhich is not very helpful.’\\n \\nThrough all this talk of Djokovic as a statesman and a diplomat, it’s important not to create\\nthe impression that the animal in him has somehow gone away. It is still very much there,\\nand while he knows how to keep it behind bars, it does make occasional appearances.\\nThe most striking of these was at the end of his marathon Australian Open final in\\nJanuary 2012, when, after shaking hands with the umpire and embracing Rafael Nadal,\\nDjokovic ripped off his shirt, roared from the bottom of his gut, and as he went over to his\\nentourage showed the body language less of the goalscorer who wants to hug his team-\\nmates and more of the warrior who wants to show he’s the leader of the pack. There was\\nsomething of the Maori ‘Haka’ about it.\\nBut there is also the occasional sense that the animal is never far away when things go\\nwrong. In the 2013 Wimbledon final, when Djokovic started getting the sense that\\neverything was against him, he lost a bit of his cool towards the end of the second set,\\nscreaming at the umpire Mohamed Layani after running out of challenges. That was\\nnothing compared with the tongue-lashing he gave another umpire, Ali Nili, in the semi-\\nfinals of the Shanghai Masters in October 2013 against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, after Nili\\njudged – correctly – that Djokovic had let a ball go, so his opponent’s successful challenge\\nto the electronic review system meant Tsonga won the point. And there was a marked\\ntransition during Djokovic’s seven-minute monologue in defence of Viktor Troicki at the\\n2013 ATP Finals – while Djokovic started off calmly and rationally, the emotions gradually\\ntook over and he ended up almost ranting.\\nThe task therefore is to keep everything in balance. His former assistant coach Dusan\\nVemic says,\\nWhen he gets the balance of his emotions right, he’s as close to perfection as he\\ncould be. If he’s too mellow: not good. If he’s too wild: not good. But when it’s just the\\nright amount, he’s a remarkable tennis player. Tennis is a sport where nowadays most\\nplayers are very square in the sense of being just another tennis player on the court,\\nbut when he’s in the right place he’s amazing to watch. When he plays for himself, you\\ncan see he’s sometimes a little more stressed, but when he plays for his country he’s\\nvery determined, very focused, a lot of good energy, especially when he plays in front\\nof our crowd – he really draws all that energy from them and always performs\\nextremely well. Sport is a great thing, it can take people of a young age away from a\\npotentially wrong path, but sometimes he needs the aggression to keep the balance\\nright.\\nHe appears always to have been like this. Jelena Gencic talked about the piercing eyes\\nthat went with his immense focus and ability to learn. And the Serbian tennis commentator',\n",
       " 'Nebojsa Viskovic, who had a long-running feud with Srdjan Djokovic, remembers meeting\\nthe 12-year-old Novak for the first time.\\nHe was very polite, with such nice manners, and respect for my age. But very\\nconfident and very serious – he looked like he was going to be a scientist. He’s very\\nclever. He almost has a split personality – one we see, the other is seen only by\\npeople in specific situations. And even as a boy he knew how to manage the\\nrelationship with me. I can’t say we were friends but we were close. Our relationship\\nwas very good all the time. After the difficulties with his father, the relationship stayed\\nstrictly professional, but at the highest level. He never told me anything [about the\\nissues Viskovic had with Srdjan], I never told him anything, neither of us brought up\\nwhat had happened. People around him were protecting him from many of the hassles\\nthat Srdjan causes. Like his father Novak has his dark side, but unlike his father he\\nknows how to shut it down and when to bring it out. He’s a great tactician.\\nMaybe that is an underestimated characteristic of greatness – the ability to keep one’s dark\\nside shut down, or at least to detonate it in a safe environment? Roger Federer has done\\nthe same, overcoming a hot-headed, sometimes petulant side to his character that\\nthreatened to hold him back, and finding ways of releasing it off-court so he can be totally\\nefficient about the management of his emotions when on court. Maybe that is why playing\\nDavis Cup is so important to Djokovic – he’s known to be unhappy about the cup’s\\nscheduling and has left officials of the International Tennis Federation in no doubt about\\nhis feelings, but he very seldom skips Davis Cup weekends. He seems to feed off donning\\nhis red Serbia shirt and playing for his country, almost as if it allows him to be a soldier for\\nhis country in a way that playing as an individual doesn’t. He can certainly let his inner\\nanimal have greater expression when playing a home Davis Cup tie than he can in most of\\nhis tour matches.\\nAnother attribute that his friends speak about is his memory. Some say he will always\\nremember a conversation, prompting many of his friends to be careful what they promise.\\nThe role of humour is also important for him. Those who have worked with him say he\\nhas a great sense of humour and a great need to play it out, but he keeps his fun time and\\nhis work time strictly demarcated. ‘He’s a lot less funny than people think,’ says Todd\\nMartin, who worked with Djokovic for several months in 2009–10, ‘and he’s a lot smarter\\nthan people think. If you sit down with him, he’s not cutting jokes the whole time, he’s a\\npretty serious guy and very smart.’ That’s why his decision to don a Hallowe’en mask for\\nhis walk on to court for a match in Basel in October 2011 was such a break from the strict\\ndemarcation between work and fun, and was pretty much a signal from him that he felt his\\nyear’s work was effectively complete.\\nAt the 2014 Australian Open he was asked what the best part of \\nbeing Novak Djokovic\\nwas. He was clearly captured by the question and gave it a few moments’ thought before\\nanswering. ‘Usually, I don’t like to talk too much about myself,’ he said, ‘I leave that to other\\npeople, but for me it’s important to always know where I come from, be grateful for the life I\\nhave, of course cherish and nurture every moment spent on the court. I don’t take any\\nsituation for granted. Being aware of all these things is the best of being Novak Djokovic.’\\nAn element of Djokovic’s life that is hard to assess in the more secular west is the role\\nthe Serbian Orthodox Church plays. It would be wrong to suggest that he is devoutly\\nreligious, but the ritualistic role the church plays in the life of Serbia is sufficiently strong\\nthat it is very much part of his life. He always wears a cross as a medallion on his neck\\nchain, and he frequently crosses himself and looks to the heavens after winning matches.',\n",
       " 'He has also contributed to church funds and in April 2011 was awarded the Order of St\\nSava, first degree, by the church’s patriarch, the highest order presented by the Serbian\\nOrthodox Church. Such is the link between the award and financial contributions that there\\nis almost a tariff for it, generally held to be around €100,000. Djokovic has certainly given\\nwell over that amount, largely to help Serbian people and the sanctuaries of the Holy\\nChurch, particularly in Kosovo and Metohija. ‘This award is certainly the most important\\nI’ve ever been given,’ he said on receiving it. ‘As an athlete and a religious person, it is\\nhard for me to find appropriate words to describe my feelings of gratitude for the confidence\\nI gain from this. It can be earned only with hard work and self-belief, belief in your loved\\nones and in God.’ (He has also been awarded the Order of the Star of Karadjordje, the\\nhighest civilian award that can be given by the Republic of Serbia.)\\nThere have been several born-again tennis players over the years, many of whom wear\\ntheir religion very openly. The Williams sisters \\noften credit ‘Jehovah’ in interviews and\\ntrophy ceremonies, and Michael Chang never missed the chance to thank ‘the Lord’\\nwhenever he spoke at trophy presentations and sponsor events. Djokovic is not in this\\ncategory and will seldom volunteer information about his faith unprompted. But the\\npresence of a faith – even if it is more ritualistic than deeply thoughtful – is no doubt a\\nfactor that helps him keep his inner animal behind bars and keeps his job of hitting a bit of\\nfluffy rubber backwards and forwards over a net in perspective.\\n \\nDjokovic has put tennis on the map in Serbia and the country has a window of, possibly,\\nanother four or five years to make the most of what is likely to be a once-in-a-lifetime\\nplayer.\\nIn the ructions that engulfed the Serbian Tennis Federation following the 2010 Davis\\nCup success, there seems little doubt the Djokovic family – particularly Srdjan – thought\\nabout founding a rival national association. But out of that carnage arose a new structure in\\nthe existing association that may have left the development of Serbian tennis in the\\nDjokovic and post-Djokovic era in better hands. While much media coverage centred on\\nthe ousting of ‘Bobo’ Zivojinovic and his replacement by the politician and UN diplomat\\nVuk Jeremic, the real change was in splitting Zivojinovic’s job into president of the\\nfederation and chair of the board. Jeremic is president of the federation, which in reality\\nmeans he chairs the annual meeting, while the chair of the board is now Toplica\\nSpasojevic.\\nA former basketball player, Spasojevic is one of the most successful businessmen in\\nSerbia, having built up his company, ITM, from nothing into a workforce of 1,400\\nemployees in seven countries. It was the distributor for Nike in Russia after the communist\\nsystem was disbanded and has had other very big contracts in the sporting world. But he\\nhas a sense of \\nnoblesse oblige \\n(or perhaps that should be \\nrichesse oblige\\n) – a belief that\\nhis success in business requires him to put something back – and he is president of\\nvarious associations and initiatives, including the Serbian chamber of commerce and\\nseveral promotional societies. He was, for a while, president of Red Star Belgrade and in\\n2011 took over as chair of the tennis federation’s board.\\nThrough his broad experience in sport, Spasojevic has observed what works and what\\ndoesn’t. He is generally impressed with how basketball built on the boom it had in\\nYugoslavia in the 1970s and 1980s, and how the Serbian volleyball fraternity has built on\\nits successes in the last decade. Out of that, he has evolved a four-point plan to make the\\nmost of the Djokovic years. Firstly, he wants to improve Serbia’s tennis infrastructure so\\nthat there are more courts and tennis facilities. There are putative plans for a national',\n",
       " 'training centre and out of that should emerge a national tennis school or academy.\\nSecondly, he wants to increase the number of tournaments in Serbia, not tournaments that\\ntop players should be attracted to (that was the mistake Germany made in the Becker-\\nStich-Graf era – when those three retired, most of the tournaments on German soil became\\neconomically unviable) but for lower-ranking players to provide them with a rising scale of\\ncompetition, so they can get further up the ladder before they have to travel internationally.\\nIn 2010 Serbia had 10 Futures tournaments (the level below Challengers, so generally\\nattracting players between 1000 and 250 in the rankings). By 2013 it was 22 and the\\nnumber is rising, and it now has 400 local ratings tournaments. Thirdly, there are plans to\\nprovide grants for the most talented youngsters to help them with the expenses needed to\\nmake the transition from being good juniors to tour players. The federation is budgeting for\\n30 kids to receive between €15,000 and €30,000 a year, and occasionally more – Serbia’s\\ntop-ranked junior Nikola Milojevic received €120,000 from the federation in 2012 to help\\nhim travel to tournaments in \\nmore exotic places than he could have afforded on his own.\\nAnd fourthly, there is a programme to train up more coaches and umpires. When all that is\\nin place, the theory is that any Serbian child who has talent and wants to play tennis can\\nfind the facilities, support and competitive opportunities they need without having to go\\nabroad.\\nWhat will count as success? ‘We’d like another Novak,’ Spasojevic says, knowing full\\nwell that players like Djokovic are rarities that no national association can legislate for.\\nCertainly the chances for one of Djokovic’s brothers look increasingly slim – Marko made it\\ninto the world’s top 600 in 2012 but has slipped back badly, while at 18 Djordje still has\\ntime but most 18-year-olds who are headed for the top 100 have done more than Djordje\\nhas (his highest ranking at the time this book went to press was 1463, which makes him\\nabout 30th in Serbia). His role model should be Patrick McEnroe – seven years younger\\nthan his illustrious brother John, Patrick had a fraction of the talent but still carved out a\\ncareer as a reasonable singles player and a top-level doubles player, and went on to be a\\nvastly more successful Davis Cup captain than John.\\nSpasojevic may well find that the legacy of the Djokovic era is that Serbia has half a\\ndozen players in the world’s top 100 a couple of decades from now, even if more of them\\nare ranked between 50 and 100 than in the top 50. The immediate outlook for the country\\nis not bad, with Niko Milojevic and Laslo Djere both shining on the junior circuit; in fact\\nSerbia even enjoyed the glow of having two boys in the world’s top three for a short period\\nin 2013.\\nMilojevic spent a period working with Dejan Petrovic, who was Djokovic’s first touring\\ncoach. Petrovic is well aware of how much easier it is for Milojevic having had Djokovic at\\nthe top of tennis. ‘Without a doubt, Novak has played a huge role in the whole of Serbia for\\nthe expansion of tennis,’ Petrovic says. ‘It’s now just a matter of how the clubs organise\\nthemselves to make the most of the \\nboom, but a lot of small kids want to be like Nole, so\\nthey look for the best tennis clubs where they live. A lot of kids choose team sports for\\nfinancial reasons because the outlay isn’t as great. Novak’s legacy will probably be a\\nstream of players between 30 and a 100.’\\nNote too that, while it would help to have Djokovic coming back home to do clinics and\\nhit balls with youngsters, the federation’s four-point strategy is not dependent on him. ‘We\\nrecognise that he needs to switch off when he’s here,’ Spasojevic says. ‘We’d like him to\\ndo as much with us as possible, but his real value to us is as a role model, and we’d like\\nhim to stay at the top for as long as possible.’\\nThe reason Spasojevic may succeed where others have – or might have – failed is not',\n",
       " 'his experience, although that clearly helps. It’s his belief that his work should be invisible,\\nso he’s not looking to capture the limelight. One of the first diplomatic things he did on\\ntaking over from Zivojinovic was to find ‘Bobo’ a role as honorary president-for-life of the\\nfederation. That allows Zivojinovic to be an ambassador for Serbian tennis, to carry out the\\nglad-handing side of the role, which his laid-back personality makes him good at, to be on\\nthe ITF’s Davis Cup committee and other bodies, and leave the nitty-gritty work to harder-\\nheaded and more organised people. Spasojevic, a tall, handsome man with a calming\\npresence, has also overseen a quiet, behind-the-scenes \\nrapprochement\\n with Srdjan\\nDjokovic. Gone are the threats from Srdjan to set up a rival national association, and\\nSpasojevic talks of having a ‘stable long-term relationship’ with both Srdjan and Goran. So\\npeace may be gradually breaking out in the ranks of Serbian tennis. If it is, the chances of\\nthe country profiting in the longer term from Djokovic’s legacy are good.\\nBut the mountain it needs to climb is still a massive one. ‘We have just a thousand kids\\nplaying tennis,’ bemoans Bogdan Obradovic, Serbia’s Davis Cup captain and the owner of\\nan academy in central \\nBelgrade. ‘In China you have 50 million kids playing, in America 10\\nmillion, even a country like Australia has one million, but we just have a thousand. There\\nare probably around a hundred thousand kids in Serbia who want to play tennis, but it’s\\nsuch an expensive sport that they don’t even try it because they have no money.’\\n \\nThe truth is that, despite Djokovic, Serbia will not be relying on tennis for securing its place\\nin the world’s consciousness. Serbia is a relatively small country in a part of the globe\\nwhere the number of ‘new’ states has exploded over the past two decades, so if it is to\\nstand out, it will have to do so for other reasons.\\nEconomically, it has signalled its intention to be part of the European Union. Assuming it\\nbecomes a member in the next five years or so, it will gain the weight of the EU’s combined\\nnegotiating power in world affairs, although some argue it will become just another small\\nmember state and therefore lose something of its identity. Harmonised minimum standards,\\nwhich Serbia would be obliged to sign up to in a whole range of industrial and social areas\\n(everything from limits on working hours to the amount of sulphur allowed in diesel), exist\\nto guarantee roughly equal conditions for trading across all states of the Union and do not\\nhave to mean the dilution of a country’s culture. But some EU citizens feel that acquiescing\\nwith EU rules has indeed diluted their national and regional culture, and a defiant people\\nlike the Serbs might find that difficult.\\nSmoking is an interesting social barometer in this regard. The fact that some tennis\\ncoaches in Serbia don’t show even a flicker of embarrassment by lighting up in a café,\\nwhen their work is supposed to be promoting a high level of fitness and healthy living,\\ntestifies to how much smoking is very much part of the culture. A meal in a traditional\\nSerbian restaurant resembles a trip down Memory Lane for those from many western\\nEuropean nations, \\nAmerica and Australia, with clothing impregnated with stale smoke the\\nmorning after. The EU does not ban smoking but it does require its member states to offer\\nnon-smoking areas in restaurants and certain other public places, and to some this is the\\nthin end of the wedge towards a ban. The ‘Novak’ restaurants and cafés have been\\npioneers in Serbia in offering non-smoking areas (as well as options such as gluten-free\\nfood), so Djokovic has helped his people along the road to healthier living. But the Serbs\\ncan be trenchant in defending their right to smoke, almost as if they are proud of being\\ndifferent from those in the west.\\nDespite its traditional diplomatic, religious and linguistic connections to Russia, Serbia\\nis unlikely to have the same difficulty putting its faith in Europe as Ukraine has had.',\n",
       " 'Moscow is likely to be less worried about Serbia leaning towards the west than it has been\\nwith Ukraine – after all, Serbia’s eastern neighbours, Romania and Bulgaria, have both\\nbeen members of the EU since 2007, Serbia is not as important an economic partner to\\nRussia as Ukraine is, and Ukraine shares a border with Russia while Serbia doesn’t.\\nSerbia was important to Russia in the latter decades of the 19th century but it is too small\\nto be of major significance to Moscow now, whereas Ukraine is a much larger land mass\\nand has (or at least still had at time of writing) a lot of the former USSR’s Black Sea\\ncoastline, in particular the Crimean peninsula with its strategically significant port cities of\\nSevastopol and Yalta. (The big parallel between Serbia and Ukraine is the risk that\\nUkraine’s mix of Orthodox and Catholic communities could ignite in a civil war similar to\\nthat between the Serbs and Croats in the early 1990s, a concern that was very much alive\\nas this book went to press.)\\nIt’s hard to see an industry in which Serbia could shine transnationally, the way Brazil\\nand Kenya do for their coffee, Argentina does for the tango, and countless cities and states\\ndo for their tourist appeal. If Emir Kusturica’s film of Andric’s novel \\nThe Bridge over the\\nDrina\\n becomes a hit, the Balkans could become a cultural attraction, a bit like Vienna\\nenjoyed the glow of Carol Reed’s \\nThe Third Man\\n for several decades after it was released\\nin 1948, but while Serbia might benefit from much of the ensuing tourism, Visegrad and\\nAndricgrad are not actually in Serbia but just across the border in Bosnia.\\nIt looks like Serbia’s best chance of achieving international recognition is through\\nanother sporting success. The most fertile ground is football, and if either Red Star\\nBelgrade or the Serbian national team could discover a golden generation of players,\\nSerbia could yet find itself much more in the international consciousness than it is at the\\nmoment. But then again, Croatia had the massive boost of coming third in the 1998 football\\nWorld Cup – yet how high is Croatia’s profile in international consciousness today? In a\\ncrowded global market place that sees more than 200 countries take part in the opening\\nceremony of the summer Olympics, it’s very hard to make your mark if you’re not one of the\\ntraditional big nations. To that extent, having a global name carrying the flag, as Djokovic\\ndid at the 2012 London Olympics, is probably as much of a magnet for the world’s attention\\nas a country like Serbia is ever going to get.\\n \\nDjokovic will of course still be Serbian even after he stops playing tennis, but the question\\nof Serbia’s standing in the world leads on to the question of what Djokovic will do when he\\nfinally hangs up his rackets. There are certain jobs he could walk into, like television\\ncommentator, entertaining performer on the oldies’ tennis tour (especially with his\\nimpersonations), and he can be Serbia’s Davis Cup captain pretty much at the time of his\\nown choosing.\\n‘He can do whatever he wants,’ says his friend Ivan Ljubicic. ‘I can do whatever I want\\nand I’m only two per cent of what he is. I can tell you he’s not going to sit and relax, that’s\\nfor sure. \\nDavis Cup captain or TV commentator? He’s bigger than that. I think he has to\\nhave an important role where he feels he can make a big difference.’\\nThat reflects the general consensus of those interviewed for this book – he will want\\nsomething demanding, something in which he can make a difference. The question is:\\nwhat? There are three obvious areas in which he could end up: some administrative\\nposition in tennis or sport in general, something ambassadorial/diplomatic, or politics.\\nWhen Jelena Gencic died, Djokovic talked about continuing or following up on her\\nlegacy. The word ‘legacy’, when applied to Gencic, could be taken to mean any number of\\nthings but the obvious area would be in tennis development. Even now, his passion for',\n",
       " 'both the game and his country means he’s always willing for the Serbian juniors to practise\\nwith him. The fact that, as world No. 1, he had a number of negotiations with leading\\nfigures in tennis’s governing bodies means he has had an apprenticeship in how the game\\nis run, with the chance to develop his own thoughts and ideas as to how it might be better\\nrun.\\nThe television commentator Nebojsa Viskovic says, ‘He’s a man with such a big field of\\ninterest, I just can’t imagine what could fill him in the future. When I look at Vlade Divac, he\\nwas the greatest basketball player in Yugoslavia, now he’s president of the Serbian\\nOlympic Committee – I could never see him doing that during his playing days. So who\\nknows what Novak could do?’ Djokovic himself has spoken admiringly about the\\nresponsibility Divac has taken on, which doesn’t of itself mean he will look to do something\\nsimilar, but it’s not a massive leap of the imagination to see him as president of the Serbian\\nTennis Federation, the Serbian Olympic Committee, or something of that ilk.\\nHis popularity in Serbia and the respect his compatriots have for him means a political\\ncareer is always a possibility. ‘If he’s going to \\nparticipate in politics, I’m going to help him,’\\nsays the former president Boris Tadic (conveniently overlooking the possibility that\\nDjokovic might not want his help – Tadic isn’t held in the highest regard among Serbia’s\\nchattering classes). Tadic adds, ‘If he ran for president, he would win.’ He would now, but\\npolitics is a much more complicated business than just milking your own popularity.\\nAlliances have to be formed, sometimes with unlikely allies; programmes have to be\\nformulated that are distinctive enough to catch the public imagination but appeal to a wide\\nenough section of the electorate that they can be carried through; events can overtake the\\nbest-laid plans; and the media has to be managed. In an era of 24-hour news coverage\\nand the rumour mill that is social media and the broader Internet, managing information is\\ncrucial. Many an honest politician sets out with the aim of saying things straight and giving\\nhonest answers, and then realises that this approach risks conceding the political agenda\\nto whomever is asking the questions; so they clam up, become careful with their\\nutterances, and are soon as colourless as all their political colleagues. Is Djokovic capable\\nof playing that particular game? Does he even want to? He says no, though that could\\nchange.\\nDusan Vemic, who has spent a lot of time with Djokovic on the road in recent years,\\nbelieves Djokovic is aware of the pitfalls of politics. ‘I don’t think he will get into politics,’\\nVemic says, ‘I don’t think he’s interested, but if he did go into politics, it would probably be\\nwith a big idea with which he wants to make a difference.’\\nAnd when Dejan Petrovic says, ‘Nole can be like Tito, doing the job of uniting people,’\\nhe may well be right, but how? He would need a role and it’s hard to see – at the moment –\\nwhat that role could be.\\nViskovic appears to be on a similar wavelength to Petrovic and Vemic. ‘He’s doing for\\nSerbia what nobody could do,’ he says. ‘If he ran for president, he’d win it 100 per cent. But\\nhis family is \\ndown in the public’s estimations because they represent Serbia in a very\\ndifferent way. I think it helped him that he had to tell them to calm down; their behaviour in\\nthe crowd was a disgrace. The people of Serbia have had enough of ugly things, they just\\nwant something nice to happen – Novak is nice but his family is not nice. So yes, he could\\nbe president, but it would be much smarter to be an ambassador.’\\nSo what of an ambassadorial or diplomatic role? It’s important to stress that the terms are\\nused loosely here because the role of a country’s ambassador to a foreign capital, or of a\\ndiplomat representing a government in transnational negotiations, is a very precise and\\nconstrained one. Djokovic is already an ambassador for his clothing and racket',\n",
       " 'companies, and there are doubtless hundreds of Serbian (and non-Serbian) firms that\\nwould be delighted to send him on the road to represent them and put in a good word for\\nthem. But would that really satisfy someone of boundless energy and an active but focused\\nmind? It’s hard to think it would.\\nIn 1980 the then US president Jimmy Carter appointed the former world heavyweight\\nboxing champion Muhammad Ali as a special US envoy to Africa. Ali was to go to a\\nnumber of African countries and encourage them to join the US boycott of the 1980\\nMoscow Olympics in protest at the USSR’s invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. It\\nwould be easy to see Djokovic taking on such a task, especially if there was a children\\nelement involved that would dovetail with his foundation’s work, or a peace element that\\nwould allow him to say – as he did at the 2013 US Open – that he’s ‘totally against any\\nkind of weapon, any kind of air strike or missile attack’. But anything like that would be a\\nshort-term assignment. It’s easier to see him taking on an international charitable role, or\\npossibly even a United Nations function that would be a development of his work as a\\nUnicef ambassador.\\n‘I think an ambassadorial function would be possible for a lot of the guys who have\\nplayed tennis,’ says the twice Grand Slam runner-up Todd Martin.\\nIt’s a global game. At one moment you have to fight like a dog against somebody\\ncompeting for the same prize. The next moment you have to share a locker room with\\nthat same person. The next moment you have to schmooze at a cocktail party with\\npeople you don’t speak the same language as, or whatever it is. These are the talents\\nthat go into being something of that ambassadorial nature. Many players can learn the\\nstuff that’s necessary to do their job, but there are a few like Roger and Novak who are\\nplenty smart enough to learn all the wider stuff.\\nAsked what role he sees for himself after his top-level playing days are over, Djokovic\\nappears to be leaving all options open when he says, ‘I will be trying to give as much as I\\ncan to my country, but not in a form of a politician. I think there are many ways to help, and\\ncurrently I choose to do it through my charity, the Novak Djokovic Foundation.’\\nMost of the world’s top athletes have charitable foundations these days, prompting\\ncynics to wonder whether these are motivated more by reasons of tax advantages than by\\ngenuine concern for the wider world. It’s a difficult question to answer – if a government\\nclaims less in tax because some citizens are paying a certain amount of their income into a\\ncharitable foundation, the donors don’t benefit personally; in effect, they simply decide how\\nto spend some of the tax they would have had to pay anyway. Does that allow us to judge\\nhow strong their charitable motives really are?\\nWith Djokovic’s foundation, the motivation is somewhat closer \\nto heart. In a ‘letter’\\noutlining the rationale behind the foundation, he writes, ‘I’m coming from a war torn\\ncountry, a place where many kids do not dare to dream big. I was blessed to have the\\nsupport of my whole family throughout childhood. They believed in me and dreamed with\\nme, all the way. Today, I have realised my childhood dream. It is very important for me to\\nstart building my philanthropic legacy now, while I’m young and have a lot of people’s\\nattention. I want to share the focus that is on me with the work of my foundation and help\\nmany kids to fulfil their dreams. They can learn from my example – many things are\\npossible if we believe and work hard.’\\nDjokovic started the ‘Novak Fund’ in 2007 – essentially a pot of money that could be\\nused for all sorts of diverse projects, such as emergency relief efforts in areas that had\\nsuffered from fighting or extreme weather, grants for kids who needed medical treatment',\n",
       " 'outside Serbia, travel grants for young players to go to tennis tournaments, and even\\ndonations to fund the upkeep of historic churches and monasteries. But in February 2012\\nhe changed it into the Novak Djokovic Foundation (NDF), with his girlfriend Jelena Ristic\\nas chief executive and a more specific focus on children, largely in Serbia but also around\\nthe world. In September 2011 Djokovic was named a Unicef ambassador – so are plenty of\\nother athletes, but his role was specifically to help raise the awareness of low enrolment\\nrates in pre-school education in Serbia, given that Serbia has one of the lowest\\npercentages of children in pre-school education (44 per cent).\\nOut of this has arisen a trio of projects supported by the foundation that reflect the\\nthinking of Friedrich Froebel, the 19th-century German educationalist who developed the\\ntheory that, if you meet a child’s needs in the ‘early years’ (which he defined as three to\\nseven years old), they will by and large be able to deal with anything you throw at them\\nafter that. Froebel coined the term \\n‘Kindergarten’ out of his conviction that children under\\nseven learn best by playing in the garden, and devotees of Froebel’s work tend to set up\\nschools with low numbers of under-sevens and a strong focus on outdoor learning; they\\ntend to be known as ‘small schools’. It’s easy to see how Djokovic’s belief in a child’s right\\nto dream and Froebel’s care and attention up to age seven fit together, and one of the NDF\\nprojects is the ‘Skolica Zivota’, which best translates as ‘small school for life’. Djokovic\\nsays on his foundation’s website,\\nThe project has developed as an expression of our desire to encourage children to\\ndream, and also inspire adults to do everything in their power to help kids realise\\nthose dreams. Kindergartens, parks and playgrounds are natural schools of life, where\\nchildren play and learn through play, resolve situations, and make friends for life. We\\nwant those places to become something more – to become seedbeds of goodwill, the\\nright values, activism, self-care, and caring concern for others. It is the best way to\\nstrengthen parents, professionals, local communities, and above all children; to regain\\ntheir strength, self-confidence and faith in life; a belief that they can do something for\\nthemselves, their present and future. Only that way will new generations of\\nresponsible citizens emerge, of people who care about each other and the\\nenvironment they live in.\\nThe ‘Skolica Zivota’ project currently assists four schools but the scope for it to help more\\nis obviously immense.\\nIn parallel, Djokovic has recognised that a good small school in itself may not be enough\\nto help children to dream, or to realise those dreams, if the child’s home life is not nurturing.\\nThat’s why the foundation is undertaking a major project jointly with Unicef and the\\nSerbian government called ‘Supporting Families at Risk’. \\nThe aim is to prevent the\\nseparation of children from their families, by strengthening families to cope with crises so\\nthey can still provide their children with adequate care in a safe and stimulating\\nenvironment. A team of ‘family outreach workers’ is working with 53 families\\nencompassing 118 children. Ristic says,\\nThis service has been necessary in the social protection system for several reasons.\\nFirst of all, our centres are overcrowded with families in need. Social workers simply\\ndo not have time for continual work to enable children to become stronger and modify\\ntheir behaviour. They are working on 300 cases per year, and our staff will need two\\nand a half years for this because attention and dedication, as well as time, are\\nrequired for accomplishing the results. A child’s biological family is irreplaceable, and',\n",
       " 'in most cases it has no alternative. Of course there are situations when there’s a threat\\nto the life of a child and it must be removed from the family. But there are many more\\nsituations where families just need someone to direct them, to give a suggestion, to\\nmotivate them, take them to the doctor, provide documents, to enrol their child in\\nkindergarten, to give them advice on how to overcome the situation. All those families\\nmust voluntarily agree to be included in the service. We are sure that after six months\\nthey will be much stronger.\\nInterestingly, the third project of the trio is a children’s toy library in Kragujevac, which\\nincludes provision for Roma children, particularly vulnerable ones. The library lends out\\nnot just toys but material with inherent teaching characteristics. Given the way the Roma\\ncommunity has often been ostracised from Serbian society, this is not just a children’s\\nwelfare project but one that has an element of breaking down barriers caused by prejudice.\\n‘Our mission is to help children in disadvantaged communities to grow up, play and\\ndevelop in stimulative and safe environments while learning to respect others and care for\\nthe environment,’ Djokovic says. ‘Many people around the world have recognised my\\nfoundation and joined us in our mission.’\\nAlthough he relaunched the foundation in February 2012, it really got going at a\\nfundraising dinner in New York in September 2012, which raised $1.4 million for early-\\nyears education. A week later he visited a Unicef kindergarten in the town of Lesnica, and\\na month after that he launched the initiative ‘Clothes for Smiles’ with his clothing supplier\\nUniqlo, a programme that aims to help nurture the dreams of children worldwide. For all\\nthis, he was recognised by the British homelessness charity Centrepoint, which awarded\\nhim its first Premier Award at the seniors’ tennis tournament at London’s Royal Albert Hall\\nin December 2012. Djokovic received the award from Prince William, the heir-but-one to\\nthe British throne and a keen tennis fan who has watched matches at Wimbledon and the\\nAustralian Open.\\nWhen Djokovic talks about his foundation, the word ‘dream’ is ever present in his\\nvocabulary. ‘Let’s believe in their dreams together!’ he writes on the foundation’s website\\nand, when he was appointed a Unicef ambassador, he said, ‘Through my work with\\nUnicef, I want to help Serbian children realise their dreams. I want to help them understand\\nthat they have rights and that those rights should be protected. I want them to believe that\\nanything is possible.’\\nIt’s almost as if these are the emotions that he can’t let out until the conclusion of a\\nmatch; this is the idealism that is the counterweight to all the hard work he puts in on the\\npractice court and in the gym. It is this side of Djokovic that makes so many people think he\\nwill end up in some way involved in a cause to change the world for the better. Dusan\\nVemic says, ‘He’s realising \\nmore and more that he’s a giving person, and I believe\\nwhatever he does in the future will reflect that idea of making a difference – I think he\\nrealises that he already makes a big difference in the lives of millions of people in this\\ncountry, and many athletes look up to him around the world’\\n \\nAre we reading too much into Djokovic the person? Should we perhaps simply view him\\nas a man whose passion is playing tennis, who does it so well he’s one of the world’s\\ngreatest, and that, as an intelligent human being, he takes an understandable interest in\\nthe rest of the world but that it’s no more than that? There’s a case for it, but it would almost\\ncertainly be selling him short.\\nThere are essentially three elements to Djokovic’s greatness. The first two are at play',\n",
       " 'with all successful athletes, and other performers for that matter: natural abilty and\\ndedication. Some people have all the natural ability but insufficient dedication, while others\\nhave modest ability but a blinding determination to succeed that takes them past more\\ngifted rivals. Djokovic has both phenomenal natural talent and the drive to make the most\\nof it. He needs both these attributes to succeed in the fiercely competitive world of today’s\\nprofessional tennis. You can say the same for Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy\\nMurray, and for top players from past eras and even for those players who fall just behind\\nthem in the rankings.\\nBut that determination – the single-mindedness needed to succeed in an environment\\nwhere the slightest weakness is punished – leads to a crop of largely dull personalities.\\nThat is no criticism – if your life from the age of around six or seven is dominated by\\npractice after school, and most weekends and summer holidays being consumed by tennis\\ncamps and tournaments, and you then have to subject yourself to a disciplined regime of\\nfitness and tennis training for pretty much 52 weeks of the year, it’s not a recipe for well-\\nroundedness. \\nBut every now and then a person comes through this brutal regime with the\\nnatural intelligence to take such a weird existence in their stride and get a sense of the\\nworld from it. They emerge with their personality intact, and that makes them seem so\\nnormal when they are anything but. Djokovic is one of these, and this is the third element of\\nhis greatness.\\nHe is not alone in this. His closest match is Roger Federer, who also combines natural\\nability, a serious work ethic and a charming personality that manages to see the big\\npicture. The relationship between Federer and Djokovic hasn’t always been smooth, but\\nthey have tremendous mutual respect for each other and any tension may stem from the\\nfact that they are both remarkable sporting statesmen, both of them once-in-a-lifetime\\nfigures who happen to be around at the same time. Compliments for Federer and Djokovic\\nimply no criticism of the other members of the phenomenal ‘big four’ of the current tennis\\nera, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray. Nadal’s inherent good nature and Murray’s quiet\\ndown-to-earthness make them equally admirable as people as well as athletes, and it’s\\npossible that Murray may mature into someone of Federer’s and Djokvic’s intellectual\\nstature. But for the moment, Federer and Djokovic are the seriously smart cookies who are\\nmore than just great sportsmen but international icons who transcend the boundaries of\\ntheir sport and their respective countries.\\nThey also bear comparison with past eras. Rod Laver was the most successful player of\\nthe first period of ‘open’ tennis, but he had a quiet, understated personality that meant he\\nwas never more than a great sportsman. The same goes for Bjorn Borg, albeit with much\\ngreater star appeal than Laver ever had. Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe both\\ntranscended their sport, but their brash personalities always made them controversial\\nfigures rather than players to admire beyond their sporting and competitive abilities. Boris\\nBecker was the most charismatic player of his generation but never sought \\nto be a leader,\\nonly a personality. And of the 1990s generation, Pete Sampras was the most successful\\nbut was never comfortable in the limelight, while Andre Agassi was too much of a troubled\\nsoul to make the most of his immense natural intelligence; of that generation, Jim Courier\\nwas the most eloquent, yet his eloquence only really developed after his playing career\\nstopped and he wasn’t at the top for long enough to make a serious mark. The only other\\nfigures from the open era of tennis who might rival Federer and Djokovic are two women:\\nBillie Jean King and Martina Navratilova. They were both pioneers but have probably been\\nappreciated more since their playing days than during them. What Federer and Djokovic\\nhave achieved is the mixture of greatness and admiration during their careers (Federer',\n",
       " 'more than Djokovic), to the point where they both merit the term ‘statesman’ in a way few\\nothers do.\\nUltimately, what people like Djokovic mean to those they inspire is up to the individual\\nwho’s inspired by them, and it’s going to be different from person to person. The Serbian\\nplayer and coach Dusan Vemic says touchingly, ‘I’m really happy that I have him in some\\nway or fashion in my life, so I can reflect on him as a human being, a great role model, a\\ngreat example. I’m well aware that my best is not as good as his best, but the example he\\nsets is that I still feel motivated to make the effort to do my best. As a human being, he’s got\\nto the point where he represents his country and his comrades, all the positives. It’s very\\npure. His motives are very straightforward and innocent, and it shows.’\\nThe world won’t stop when Novak Djokovic hangs up his tennis rackets, nor will Serbia\\ncease to exist. In fact, Serbia will probably be a much richer country at the end of his\\nplaying career than it was at the beginning. But at that point we will start to get a sense of\\nwhether Djokovic was ‘just’ a tennis player, or whether he will go on to achieve great\\nthings on whatever stage he chooses to enter. He \\nhas the intellectual capacity and\\nbenevolent personality to put together his experiences of family struggles, the Belgrade\\nbombing, Jelena Gencic’s worldly wisdom, being booed in a 23,000-seater tennis stadium,\\nfighting through the pain barrier in a near-six-hour final, and others, and emerge as\\nsomeone with a major contribution to make. The coach Dejan Petrovic says, ‘Whatever\\nNovak would have touched, in any sport, he’d have succeeded. He just had that hunger for\\nwinning that was incredible. He would work immensely to achieve that; he never said, “I’m\\ntired, I can’t do that.”’ If Djokovic brings that same hunger to his next career, it might yet be\\nthat the sport of tennis was merely the launch pad for the career of a global statesman.',\n",
